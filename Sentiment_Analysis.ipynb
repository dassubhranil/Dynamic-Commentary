       "\"I was like, wow, that's pretty strong, especially with some of the strong, you know ideas about the game that that you have on your team with Jensen and Bwipo, but it really seems to be working out for them. They even have good vibes, like Bwipo's hyping up his young bottom lane, you know, after every couple kills and he's going over there hugging them and everything. It really does seem like this FlyQuest team deserves to be at the top and should be projected to stay at the top. think that to me was the big difference between where they are and where I expected them to be was I think that Masu and Busio have been a lot better a lot faster than I expected like I thought that they could get there, but I wasn't really sure how good they would be early on, right? And the reality is the game is largely played around bot lane, and if you're bot lane's just a black hole where everything goes to die, then you're not going to win that many games. But no, they've actually been really, really solid. We saw them absolutely clap the C9 bot lane, which I guess a lot of people are kind of doing these days, we can get to that later, but no, they just seem to be kind of working really well together. They're playing pretty confidently, they're like, even in the games where things are going wrong they still seem to be able to play like pretty aggressively and still kind of stay on the right foot with that so it's been really fun to watch because these are two guys who you know are coming up But from NACL, relatively recently, they both won Most Valuable Prospect, so it's cool to see that some of this NA talent is actually doing well. And I know Iwilldominate tweeted out really just recently that he thought part of the reason that this what was so entertaining was not only the parody but he thinks that mechanically this is like maybe the best LCS has been in a long time. You know and partially I think that is because we have a lot of these like new players coming up Yeah, I could totally see that. I think that um I was gonna say kind of contrary to that, I think FlyQuest's bot lane, while they are doing pretty solid, they have shown some weakness, even in some of the games they've won. they've had kind of rough laning phases and I mean if you guys remember FlyQuest one loss was probably like the hardest loss any team has had all split that was one where you know bot lane... yeah bot lane just went horribly in the beginning and then they started like siphoning all resources to try to stabilize and they just couldn't get there so I guess that's what I was worried would happen in a lot more games. Yeah, I mean, definitely not trying to take anything away from them. They've done well. I think that, um, it's tough, you know, coming into the league, and I wonder if other teams will start putting more focus down there trying to pressure them some and if they'll be able to handle it. Yeah especially everyone's thinking of the FlyQuest versus Cloud9 like kind of hype matchup where They're double killing Berserker and Vulcan multiple times by themselves and like that started a really hype super week I feel like. FlyQuest being the only team to get a 3-0 Super Week just feels like they have so much momentum and that carried on too. I was like that was two really good Varus games. For Masu, and then what was this other champ that he played in the third game? It's something else, but it was pretty it was pretty good as well. I think it was Aphelios, right? He was he was scaling and that was that was decent too. I just feel like Busio, you know, winning multiple player of the games as well. Nautilus hooks on point, just Yeah, definitely a lot better, I feel like, than the timeline that was set out. Oh, that Nautilus hook on Volcan? Yeah, that lollipop. That was so nasty. Dude, people are flaming that online saying, oh, this just shows how OP Nautilus is, it's so easy to hit hooks. You still have to know exactly where to throw it, not just to have it hit. the tower right? You go and do it then if it's so OP. Nautilus can be annoying to play against, but I like him. I like what Nautilus' meta, I think he makes things happen. He'll get a lot of kills or he'll get a ton of deaths like you know. Or both. It's never gonna be a boring game. No I agree and I mean it's like the hook the hook cheats for sure. but he was abusing it to the maximum and that's what a pro player should do, right? You should be able to find those angles. It's like when I watch really good Bard players, like I play quite a bit of Bard and the The Bard Q cheats a lot, but some people go for Qs that I would never even attempt, and it like, hits them, then turns sideways with hooks, and I'm like, how did you even know that that would work? That was gonna work. That angle looks like that should never work. They 100% cheat. It cheats like crazy, but knowing exactly how far you can take it, I think really is a lot of it. Right, you know, especially on champions that are not super mechanically difficult. It's all about, you know game knowledge and understanding Okay, exactly. Like how far can I go? You know, what's the difference? the best Nautilus player and the worst Nautilus player, exactly when you can engage, you know, how to play out the fights, how you can abuse these things to the maximum, and that's always something that I've kind of found impressive about even some of the base It's the same thing, like, Tryndamere people talk about, you know, it's like, this champion doesn't do anything, you just spin and right-click them. But, one thing that I've always found impressive about, like, really, really good Tryndamere, It's just their understanding of exactly when they can dive people and exactly when they can pull off these exactly when they can create Yeah, it's very true. Same thing with you me like you need to know exactly when you can just on your AD carry the whole game. When you go get a snack. Those Tryndamere players are watching Netflix. You know your bathroom timings, your popcorn breaks. But Bwipo, Inspired, and Jensen also I think doing a really good job. Jensen had a monster Tristana game this week against Digg after kind of the trash talk back and forth about the current crop of Korean imports being overrated. He went up against Dove, and Ex6Ten was on that pros with him, so he was like, well. We'll see how you do against Dove, you know, blah, blah, and Jensen brought out the Tristana, played really well. Bwipo's been playing a lot of different stuff, Inspire's been playing a lot of different stuff, even brought out the Brand. And Brand, I think it was the only Brand game we had in the LCS, which was really surprising me because Brand had been turbo OP in Jungle it felt like pretty much this entire season. I think Boogie also played him once. Oh, did he? OK. Yeah. But I do agree. He's real strong in solo queue right now. He's one of the champions getting hit next patch. It's hard for me to know exactly how much those nerfs are going to do, but nerfs nonetheless. Especially because one of the nerfs is fixing a bug where his passive was doing more than it should. That's really hard to quantify how much that is going to nerf him, but it should be a decent tap down. I think that game specifically, like the That was the Masu Busu continual double kills on Berserker Vulcan bottom. And so Inspired just got the free farm. So it was like kind of dream brand or you're just farming away and your bottom lane is winning and your top lane is a. So he's fine up there doesn't really matter and then they were you know able to win the game despite Jojo having some pretty good You know Nico engages that gave Cloud9 just enough hope to be even more sad at the end. But I think this FlyQuest team, I 100% agree. Like they also are really flexible. in the champions that they can use. I think that's a really good point to hit on, especially with how outspoken Bwipo is. It almost seems like he's like defensive of his. unique picks, where when Sniper picked the Olaf, he was tweeting out, he was like, ah man, that Olaf, he missed the double kill angle there. These other players thinking that they know. what they could do with Olaf nah it's it felt like it's really he it's part of his identity you know and he since they're having so much success with it like all the members get to you know, talk their trash, say whatever they want, have that confidence. All right. Well, we have three teams tied in second right now. Two of them are not really surprising that they're like in second. energy you know team liquid two teams I think we're kind of predicted to be up near the top but energy obviously coming off a 1-2 super week not gonna be that happy about it but TL and Thieves both went 2-1 in the Super Week and for Heart of Thieves to be tied for second is kind of shocking. I know quite a few people had them actually in eighth even that I would say. seeing in some of the community stuff. I think I had them maybe sixth or something like that. I can't remember if I had them fifth or sixth. Yeah, I had them one higher at fifth. Okay, I can't remember. Or if you had them at fifth. then I had them at four like I was only one hired than you guys I think I put Shopify above them so I think I had them I had Shopify then hundred to use five six yeah but still for them to be in second I think is pretty crazy. And even talking to GoldenGlue before the season and the team on their expectations, I think they're really surprised. I think it was GoldenGlue even tweeted out like, wait, we're tied for a season. You know like Because there's a lot of a lot of young players a lot of new players on this team And I think expectation was definitely that it was gonna take a lot more time for them to get up to speed even when they did, I don't think they really considered that they could be competing this high up. I think a lot of people also expected Quidd to be bad. Quidd got a lot of flack last year and when he was announced even on the returning roster it was heavily criticized I thought he he's been actually great considering how much criticism was thrown at him. Yeah, there definitely still are mistakes, but like the ability to pull out that Aatrox and absolutely stomp Shopify. This is something I said on waiting room, but Shopify continually going with yeah, these unique picks of having multiple tanks on their team I don't know if it's unique when it's three scions. It's not unique anymore. No, Zach Garen, Zach. Zach Garen. Okay, the Garen was. You get a little points there. Anyways, my point is. The Garen was cap. My point was, since They, even if you're doing something that's not meta, if you continually do that same thing, then you're just always playing your own meta and people can counter it. that and really big props to Golden Glue as well as Quidd as well as Sam Spooks the assistant coach for 100 Thieves they did exactly what I was hoping for, they crafted a team that will shit on tanks, and they did just that with their double solo lane counterpicks, and they absolutely did. like steamroll it because even if you're doing your wacky stuff that's off-meta if you keep doing it then someone's going to pull up the counter and that's exactly what we want you know that's flexibility and and that reactivity and it does shine through but only if you have players that are one willing and too capable to be also flexible like that. One thing that's interesting about Hunter Thieves is of their five players, only Sniper and me. each have played the same champ more than once. Jungle, mid, and support have all played a unique champ in every single game, which, you know, it does show. you know, diversity in what they want to play, it might mean they don't necessarily know what's best or they just have a really wide array that they're comfortable with. Not really sure yet. It'll take some more time. one thing that I do wonder so I will say I've loved it oh yeah I'm at who doesn't I think that I always have this question the back of my head it's like how much of the standings right now are just who, which the best team seem to be the ones that like understand Lucian sucks. And I know we talked about this in another episode, but like it's. It's every week, every week people pick him. It's not even, it's just like, man, this is a really good Lucian game, I'm gonna pick him. It's just like, first pick me Lucian. It feels, it feels kind of stubborn. I mean, we'll talk more about Cloud9, but it's almost to the point where it's just losing every time, and then they lose, they get flamed for it, and they're like, you know what? You're wrong. I'm going to pick it. I'm going to lose again. It's not because of Lucian, guys. Like, you guys messed up that mid 2v2. Our top lane had no prio. Like, dude, I was winning my lane from levels three to before like, from levels three to four. I don't know. Actually, Lucian won one game. It's not every game that he's lost. Like, Lucian was on the winning team. He was on the winning team. He was like 0-2-1 when the game was almost over. Like, I don't know man. A dub is a dub! It is true. true and I'm so curious to see if people are gonna kind of stick with it if they're gonna feel you know be stubborn and just like no this is correct we're doing the right pick we just have to nail down our play or if they're gonna move away. I think these new Zeri and Smolder are gonna force them to stop picking this bait champion because I don't know like It's it's almost hilarious seeing teams. Just keep picking it and it's just completely horrible every time It's really funny too because Jan Was on hotline league with his coach Spawn and he had a message directly for the people criticizing Lucian picks in pro play and I can't even repeat what he said being Uh, because it was explicit and so beep beep He can criticize it and i'll keep just pointing to the willushin winner like go ahead and pick him man if you think he's Good play him, but I mean we will thank you. We can't even put the clip in the comments or anything probably Because it looks like I would just say go check it out pretty funny. He's actually, his lane is going pretty well, he's contributing in teamfights, he's actually having a pretty good season. I wouldn't say he's the best mid laner or anything like that, but definitely I think  it feels like a far cry from last year where he was just getting roasted every week. So I do think he kind of deserves his flowers, so to speak, like he should get a little bit of credit. because it feels like everyone was telling me last year no no no what you're seeing on stage it's not the real quid like he's better just trust me but I feel like a lot of times when you hear that stuff it never actually pans out. The person just keeps playing like that on stage, but he actually has he has improved and he's showing a lot better games on stage I think. Absolutely, 100 Thieves is for sure one of the teams that has improved. me most because coming into this split, you know, I think all of us had them in the bottom half of the standings and when you look at how they built their team it almost felt like they were Weren't trying right like of their roster or they're out of money. They were definitely trying I'm just saying how it looks I'm not saying how it is, but I mean of their roster last year quid received the most criticism he's the only one they kept they they put in like a bunch of rookies or then they lucked out when river We're in me golden guardians exploded and they got to get river. Yeah, but I mean All that considered I think it is a testament to you know, they're doing something, right? They're playing well It also, for me, just makes me have even more respect for River because he's a really good player and the fact that he just continually finds success on any team. he's on. Other junglers have a lot of respect for him. I was asking Spica, you know, who's the hardest jungler you've played against? He said River. Demon in solo queue so that even further emphasizes your point of any team that he is on He was at a 80% win rate in in the top of challengers I know it's Spica and a lot of people were talking about how is like that's nuts. Yeah. I mean, it's it's just It's cool seeing them do well, especially with a Meechan sniper coming in Both very green and pro play and still managing to do pretty well. Yep energy obviously bad super weak It's kind of interesting because last week we're talking about. Oh, yeah, we really thought energy was gonna have this slow start you know but hey it didn't happen at all they didn't really run into these issues because they were sitting at I guess three and one coming into super week and and looking pretty good and it seemed like they'd kind of escaped a lot of the issues that people had been hearing that they'd been having, that there'd be some difficulties incorporating HuHu, and now that's even been talked about in some... some interviews about oh yeah we're kind of like arguing a lot in the team and these types of things so where do you guys stand on on energy now you know like they're calling it falling back a little bit to where they were in Summer Split, where there's this inconsistency where they can look really good one day against a good team, then look really bad the next day against a bad team. Like, have they regressed? Is this just a blip on the radar? Where do you guys stand? I still think NRG is pretty good. When I watch their games, I'm not sitting there being like like wow this is a team that is completely clueless they do not know what they're doing I think they're solid you know they haven't won every single game I think it is gonna be tough when you have you know, a vocal leader like HuHu coming into an established team, there's going to be some friction, just getting everyone on the same page, it's natural. totally normal and so yeah I wouldn't be too worried if I was them I think they're you know doing just fine yeah I thought there's two different issues One could be this, you know, I don't think arguing is inherently a problem as long as they're able- No. As long as it's productive. Exactly.  and I have heard from multiple members on the team that they actually like having a confrontational style and bringing things up and then talking through it. Sometimes, they spend way too much time on it, and so that can be a time sink, which is definitely an issue when you only have one week and we're constantly going to live patch and you really have to- to be good with time management and what you're gonna practice and yeah that can be a drag but I think some of the things that might be a little worrying are that there are some of these like in-game mistakes that you're going whoa like this does feel like years past energy or even like CLG days when we would be criticizing them for like why are you you over chasing here? Why are you, you know, overextending diving too far in what seems like an, an obvious, like 20% chance of success type Was it the Shopify game where they had that horrible bot lane dive? Yeah, that was one of them. Um, there have been a couple of those, a couple of those. Both of Shopify's wins. by the way, are off of the other team, diving and turbo inting and then getting slammed. They're just good at playing dives. Yeah, they're the goats. Yeah, there's. There's a reason we will get to them at the bottom of the standings. But honestly, I think that NRG are going to be fine at pull it back. but these are the types of mistakes that we're kind of like, I feel like used to seeing from that squad. And so it's not complete. Surprising to me to see a couple of them. Mm-hmm. As long as they reign it in. Yeah I mean looking through their games just both their losses were to Varus Varus a champion that like the reverse Lucian, he's kind of just winning every game. I mean when there's a champion that- HOLY THE REVERSE LUCIAN! I mean it's this is how every- Got a bow and arrow. Lucian has two guns. I'm telling you every single split this will happen at the beginning of the season There's just winners and losers in life It happens like people don't always get the right read from scrims. Sometimes they're a little stubborn to change their mind and Yeah, you know sometimes people will not immediately recognize which champs are the best. And it's hard to, right? Like there's so many factors going into a game, but definitely worth noting. It's definitely. Scrim data thing too, you know, anytime a champion is garbage on stage and you talk people like well, it's winning every game scrims You know people people always Do kind of fall into that. Did you? Do you ever have any experiences with that when you guys were playing throughout your career? Because it does feel like such an obvious trap, like when you're on the outside looking in, right? Like when you're watching the games as Koshima or Akali. You're just like just stop picking at dummies like it clearly doesn't work. It's losing every time Yeah, but then you talk the pros and they're saying yeah, but we played 20 games this week and it won all of them You know I mean and it's like how do you parse those two things and make sure that you're not actually just you know Saying ah screw Lucian because we lost once on stage versus the 20 times you played in scrims and make sure you're getting the right info. I mean, it can be hard and, you know, not everyone's going to get the right read, for sure. I think you just have to try to be open-minded, and for me, I always try to understand like why something happened more than just what happened because something that would trigger me a little bit is when we would you know go into our draft meeting and bring up win rates from scrims, because to me, that doesn't matter. Like, you can lose a game that had absolutely nothing to do with a certain champion that we had. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.  was played or vice versa, you know, win a game that had nothing to do with it. And then you also have to look like, what was happening in the games? Were you picking this champ and they were limit testing random matchups? into it and running it down, was this champion getting overly fed every single game, is that a normal thing to happen? So just where are the advantages and disadvantages coming from, like what's expected to happen? And, you know, that can be very hard to keep everything in mind. Yeah. I mean, like nobody can do it. Perfect. It's, it's, uh, some of you just always have to keep. working at. And so, yeah, I mean, there's like bait picks come up all the time. Yep, absolutely. But yeah, I mean, I'm kind of on the same page. I think NRG can probably pull it back. TL, the other 2-1 team, they had a pretty good Super Week, went 2-1. Are you feeling, are you guys feeling like they're beating some of the allegations as far as only... be able to play like scaling comps and whatnot, or does this kind of still feel that way? Because I know that was kind of what I felt like I'd been seeing, and I've been seeing so many people echoing that, where it was just like, all the previous weeks, they'd pick something a little bit more aggressive on day one, lose, and then day two, they're like, Zeri, Lulu, and Azir. And then, you know, like they lose again with something a little bit more aggressive, and then they're going, okay. They were going Tristana and Aphelios and three tanks. I wouldn't say they're beating those allegations because that's what they've been doing pretty much like. tank top, tank jungle, APA on a scaling mid, and then like pretty much all range support bot lane, which, you know, it is a way to play. It's valid. It doesn't necessarily show, like, work on a ton of different things as a team, right? Like, you don't necessarily get practice. just being proactive, like being really aggressive, putting the pressure on the other team. So it is working for TL. I would like to see them try some other stuff because... I think only playing one way, you know, it's not flexible. What if the meta changes? What if people come up with strats that are really good against what you're doing? So, yeah. I would like to see them try other stuff. I mean, this last week in Super Week, they had the one Lucian game, they had one Aphelios game, they had one Ezreal game. I think the biggest part of their wins has actually just been impact on Udyr. Impact on Udyr has done so much. He has won mid lane twice for APA by roaming down there. there, he has won jungle multiple times by invading jungle, killing enemy jungler, not killing enemy jungler, but harassing enemy jungler, and then, and stealing camps. Pact is playing out of his mind right now. There have been a couple points where, even in the content that they're releasing afterwards, You know like umpty goes one way and the the like the rest of the team was like going trying to go the other way Or something like that. I think that one change we are going to see though for sure is that APA's gonna play even more. Well, I don't even know if it's a change, because he's already played a bunch of Ziggs, but Ziggs is getting buffed, so he's gonna keep playing Ziggs, and guess what? That's. really good with scaling because you have super good waveclear and two seconds off your sastral charge does make you safer and as well as the extra little bit of armor that he's getting, so I think that Team Liquid will probably play still pretty similarly. They are open to doing, obviously. the Lucian bottom lanes and a little bit of aggressive stuff. CoreJJ is, in my opinion, always best when he's on engaged supports and is like creating action for them, so. I'm I'm not particularly super worried about them only being a Scaling team. I think they can be a super action-packed team, but we have losing when they try to close it out. We have seen some of the mistakes coming in those mid-game, either going to the objectives or the team fight actually at them. Yeah, for sure. Definitely nothing in their play has indicated they can't play other styles, but like I said, I just want to see it because there have been those. You know, narratives floating around, Impact can't play carries, APA can't play, you know, assassins or whatever. And I don't know if it's true. Probably not. Probably not, but so far, we've seen them pretty much sticking to what works. Range support, scaling mid, tank top. I think we'll probably continue to see that. Yeah, I mean it's not a bad way to play, it's probably the most common way to play of all time in League. But, you know, a little bit of flexibility is not a bad thing. And as long as you have at least enough champions within that, that if you go into playoffs, you can't just get targeted out, right? Impact can play a ton of tanks. I'm not really worried about that. But every single one they have. is with him playing Udyr, and Udyr is actually 10-2 in the LCS. I think it's probably the highest win rate champion in the LCS with any number, real number of games. And APA, obviously it is still a big concern for him, like what the champion pool is looking like, I think. Because that was one of the big criticisms and questions people had coming into this split, and I don't feel like he's really changed any minds. He's just played the three champs, Azir, Ziggs, and Tristana, which were three that he was already kind of playing. And obviously there was already some criticism of how he's kind of playing the Azir. Either way, I think they're doing pretty well. It feels like MT's fitting into the team pretty well. I don't feel like there was any, it seems like there was any big downgrade from Pjosik or anything. Maybe maybe empty is a little bit less proactive. I guess then pure shake It feels like when pure shake had his best games It was him just kind of like taking over the game like as an individual whereas It feels like his good games are more enabling his team Yeah, yeah, either way. They're sitting at four and three doing pretty well the next team's down in fifth. Three and four are Cloud9 and Immortals, which is honestly shocking to say that they're tied. Yeah, I think we we had them unanimously first and eighth and they're tied right now. I mean, I don't know. I'm 0-3 super weak for Cloud9. It had nothing to do with me being a counter carry for Cloud9, but like, like the they're not a fifth place. I'm sorry like they're not they're not I would still probably put them first if I was betting on who's gonna win this way it would still be c9 because I mean look Look at their losses. They're trolling in most the games like they win. They lost when you do it four times in a row. How much can you forgive? It's dilution. They lost. with Lucian, and then they pick Lucian again! And guess what happened? They lost again. Yeah, I don't know. Frenzy, isn't it more problems, even if you just want to criticize draft? Can you criticize them more than just the Lucian? They went against CL and it was so funny, we interviewed the players, we interviewed APA and JoJo before this game, and JoJo's like yeah he's only a Ziggs one trick you take him off that you know he's bad basically and then they give them Ziggs yeah and pick Lucian and the give over I think Even Udyr as well, it was it was like their opponents are just getting to play blind pick like they're just loading in and picking wherever they want. Yes. So it's like that's that's a problem. That means you suck at drafting! It does, but at the same time, like, I don't know if you saw, uh, I think Jojo did an interview with Ashley Kang? Yeah, I saw it! And... He's saying like, you know, it's more fun this way than if we just stomp that's some cope It's kind of cope but at the same time so much fun losing four straight games. It's not did you see the play? Faces, they're having a lot of fun. Yeah, I mean they were loving it. They were having a good old time high-fiving You know dude like put them in playoffs How like put them in games? that matter, and I guarantee we're gonna not see this, at least I hope to God we don't see this, because, you know, the longer the meta goes, goes on, the more people start realizing, like, you're not just going to ignore a champ being 10-2 or Varus is like 10-5 or something. You're not just going to keep picking the champion that's never winning. I think that But, putting Cloud9 on a good draft, they're probably just going to win. My faith in them hasn't wavered. They definitely made a lot of mistakes. game 2, you can't say like, they also had a horrendous bottom lane dive, they also had a bunch of int moments which Which you can say they're trolling because you know they're good players right? Individually. I'm like, I agree with you, I know these guys are good players individually. I think they'll be better too. But if you are trolling 50% of your games you're a bad player like you're a 50% player then if you if you're trolling half the time then that's that's you. Medius is on the campaign trail here Good work for con nine, but like okay, so you read they're not immune to Chris I'm like I think I think rel for blabber is not his best champion like I'm a blabber Agreed that's not a like his rails look pretty rough like he never runs hex flash on rel He isn't even ganking though, which has been yeah, I mean that's thing like to me rel is a contract champion 100% like Rell is great if you're looking to play around your lanes to not just like yeah she's got good clear speed. but you're playing Rell, so getting super ahead doesn't actually do anything. You really want Hexflash to make more plays happen, so I think he's just kind of slotting Rell into the way he. Regularly plays jungle, which is kind of like a more carry style, which you know, I I don't think that works too Well, I don't think that's weird cuz he's he's like one of his most successful team has been like Maokai and stuff right like he can play that style champ so I don't I don't know but it has it has been not not Riftmaker Maokai that was the most garbage build of all time but I mean, yeah, I think that Cloud9 can absolutely bounce back from this. I think they're insanely talented, but I also think we can't overlook, okay, clearly there's drafting issues, but also, I mean. To me, the worst bot lane thing that I've seen in a while, it felt like, from players of this quality, was the one against FlyQuest, where it wasn't even, I think it was the initial dive, they trolled the dive. and died, but there was this one fight afterwards that actually just tilted me off the face of the planet where they were looking for this 2v2 and people were talking about, oh, like, Boosio sw- So it took vision away from the ward and in the in the bush and maybe he berserk or finish But there's like three minutes all this stuff, but yeah, but it's like okay, so maybe he could have traded the kill maybe But he loses three waves like and it would have been a one for what like it was there's just no world in which it Is good right like that wasn't even execution that was just like you are tilted for sure Yeah, that was that was a tilt player sure yeah There's just no way you fight there ever right if we're tilted and trolling half the time then we're 50% players I'm and and and I mean man. I'll turn What's wrong when it matters? They seem so inactive in the early game, which is one of the things that really, I felt, was bizarre. Watching three straight games, I think it was the Immortals game that I was casting with Flowers, and we were 31 minutes in. it's in, and I think Cloud9 has zero kills. It was one to zero at like 31 minutes. I don't think I'm exaggerating. No, I think you're right. I remember I was going through the scores and I think it was like. That game ended like six to one in kills or something. In two of Cloud9's losses, they had players with zero deaths, which is pretty... They just weren't even trying. place, which is bizarre because I always think of Cloud9 as one of the more proactive teams, the teams that isn't going to go down without a fight, if they start losing they're going to make things happen. they're gonna try, you know what I mean? But yeah, that was one of the weirdest parts about all these losses for me was, it just felt like they kind of just sat back and I don't know if they. were just thinking, Okay, my opponent's gonna make a mistake, and we're gonna capitalize on it. Let's just keep waiting. They're gonna make a mistake. They're gonna make a mistake. And then they just didn't or what the plan was like, I don't know what the comms were there, or if they thought that they were were gonna like outscale and they didn't need to fight or what but yeah those games were wildly inactive and it it is pretty shocking how how this team has looked over the last four games because they've looked really bad over the last four games. They've definitely not looked good. I'm just going to say, let's wait to see them on a game where they're not horrendously outdrafted before. We jumped to any conclusions. I was going to say, too, I did see the Ashley King interview that you're talking about with JoJo, and he was supremely confident. He was saying all the same. things as you he was like yeah we're just trolling we he'd said that we have the best players in every role he was like we you know as soon as we work together a little bit and as soon as we fix our draft, then everything's going to be fine. I do think like, you know, when you're on a team, you have to project that type of confidence,  they should also as long as they are also examining these games and and you know in review and making sure taking steps to make sure that you don't make these types of mistakes, and working out communication, you know, whatever it's going to be, rubric for the games, so that you don't make some of these calls or you can put a stop to some of these calls before they happen. And as long as they're examining the losses so that they don't happen again, rather than than just being like, ah, we were trolling. It's not going to happen again. Because if you just say that, then it probably will. Good review guys, high five. Ah, we were trolling. Review done. Which I don't think is. Yeah, I mean I will say I'm still giving them definitely benefited out I would not be shocked if they still won because the amount of talent on this team But it does start to feel a little bit like FlyQuest in summer, we were like, well, they were so good in spring. They're going to turn it around guys. They're going to, of course they're well next week for sure. Well, playoffs, come on guys. You know, and it's like, at a certain point. you have to do it and the season goes really, really fast. It's a six week season. We are halfway done. If they have another O2 week or something. then there's not going to really be any time to turn it around so I think they have to start making it work but should we jump on to Immortals who had a good weekend they went 2-1 this weekend which was pretty exciting and I think the only loss that they had I felt it was a pretty big draft gap and I think Sharks even tweeted out you know my bad kind of trolled draft or whatever, because that one was, if I'm looking back, it was the double of, they basically had Zac top, they had Rell, TK, Senna, and then Jayce. So they basically had two lethality damage dealers, and then they're playing against Kassante and Poppy, and I just remember Sniper walking at their backline 1v2'ing them. All game long and they can't even move his health right so like that one felt doomed from draft for me But the other two games they won and they look pretty solid. I mean wins against energy and cloud9. That's That's good. Two of the worst teams in the league. Two of the worst teams. Yeah, I mean, uh, good for them. Energy's died for a second, okay? Let's relax. Yeah, it's on Super League Performance. That's a 0-3 team and a 1-2 team, Covey. It is. I didn't want to like interrupt your flow, but real real quick on that because I thought it was cool Meteos said he would still predict Cloud9. to win but if I was gonna predict right now I would I would definitely take the field if you're gonna give me the field but I would I would like to be involved in your first ever die I bet we've had a proud history of having to do ice baths and wear embarrassing cosplay and other things. I mean I would bet depending on this steak yeah I don't know if I want ice bath all right what is what steak should we maybe we have to determine steaks later though because it's always Herman stakes we'll come back to see if you guys are willing to do it back It won't be big stakes. Okay, okay. You can't take the field though. You gotta take a team. Can I get two teams? You can have two teams. Okay, I'll take Energy and FlyQuest. Okay. That's a bet. Alright, we'll come up with a stake, so we'll have the stakes for next week. Okay. That they'll agree upon, because we don't want to waste too much time thinking about that, but there you go, first bet. Just for fun, what would what would your team to predict if I had to take two teams if you could predict right now? Would you predict cloud 9 or would you take two other teams? still pretty caught on okay I still I still have now we get a test do it wait do you want in on the bet how does that even work either we're depending on the On the rewards, either both of you lose or both of you win, and I'm the only one who loses. Who cares? All right, we're in there. Yeah, I mean, you would probably have better odds. is the smarter bet, but if I was, but you asked me if I want to pick one team, but either way, I still believe they could turn it around, but yeah, Immortals, Immortals I think. has been doing a lot better. It's also fun for me to see a team that everyone was like, this team is trash, actually do well and not only pick up some wins but put up fights in some of their losses. also. It was kind of cool. I actually went and I saw some of their scrims. Flowers and I went into their compound last week before their games on the day before super week and then they They won the next day and they're like, well, you guys come back next week, right? But yeah, no, it was kind of cool seeing some of the things that they were working on and even some of the things that we saw them practicing in scrims. bring out on stage. Not all of it worked and not all of it worked like the way that they were talking about it in scrims but it was it was interesting to see some of the stuff that they were working on like as a squad some of the things that they were focusing on. Can you share what things? Anything interesting? Can you leak all their pics? I mean, can you... Definitely leak all the pics. I mean, I think, I would say that one of the really big things that they were focusing on... was communication and I think this would be fine for me to share is just like for example like they were all like communicating pretty well as far as just like general stuff. But they wanted to be really focused on more like what the goals needed to be in the game. So it's like more talking about like what you need as a player to succeed in the game versus like what is happening. Like everyone's, I think was talking a lot about like, okay, you know, he's going to be there. This is happening now. I'm going to reset, you know, they're talking about that stuff. But I think they were trying to like really improve on. Okay, how do we win this game? Okay, we need to get the dragon. So then we need to be talking about, okay, how do we get the dragon? So then we need to be talking about, okay, when are we gonna base, what are our base timings gonna be? How are we gonna set up vision? And like, where do you need? award for a flag, you know, all these sorts of things, those kind of next steps, because it felt like all the players watching them were actually doing really well individually, like as far as the scrims are going mechanically, they all seemed like they were doing well, everything was working, but they felt like that next step was what they were trying to work towards, is really being cohesive on where they want to go in the game and how to get there. there and so I think it was kind of fun to see that and it'll be interesting to see if they can you know like watching them through that lens I could kind of see how they were trying to work on that on stage. I kind of miss the scrim culture, I guess, in that way. Because I did something similar with C9 a week or two ago, where I was just stopping by the house. to like talk to Jack and a scrim was going on so I just watched the game and like it really brought back a lot of good memories for me just like the stuff that happens in scrims that like you don't really see out outside of it, like, I don't know, people just like getting really tilted, just like crazy all-ins that you would never see otherwise. It's just like, yep, this is a scrim. There are, there are some, there's some pretty. troll scrims I would say at least the scrims I watched were pretty disciplined overall but there was one like five minute remake that was pretty funny where it was just an all out brawl. see that it's like it used to be it's probably still the case if Gangplank ever comes back into the meta like my god it's so demonic bro like the game will be decided by level one top lane someone's winning or going 0-10. There was a this game that lives right free in my head and I can probably talk about it because there's a long time ago now. It was an Echo Fox versus CLG scrim. from forever ago. Cooney, right? Yeah, it was Cooney. Yup, yup, every game. And I watched this whole scrim block, and it was like, game one, level one, fight to the death. between him and I think it was like Darshan or something at this time, this level one fight to the death remake. Game two, there's like a five-man invade for a red buff, and the other team's five-man st- stacked at red buff, both top laners die, both TP back to the level 1 fight, and I'm just like, there's no way you would do this, you could never convince me in a million years. They would be TPing back, and it was like the blue team's red buff, so it's bot lane that they're TPing back to, basically. And I was just like, it was so funny, man. Instant Remake into Game 3 was a level 1 fight to death into Remake. Great info gained. I swear, like, literally back in our first LCS split, there was a... You know, the team, they had like a ton of different names, like Vulcan, xDG, and stuff, but that team, we would have the most curse scrims against them. I remember one time it was like an hour of straight remakes. It would be like, we were just level one, fighting each other to the death every time. And I'm sitting there like, guys, what are we doing? Like, this is such a waste of time. And then. High and Lemon were like, no, they don't win this fight, if they take this fight, we're fighting them. I'm just like, bro, this is literally never going to happen in a game, what are we doing? It was crazy. It's so funny. Yeah, there's some really funny stories from scrims, but I will say in the scrims that I've watched in recent years, overall, I feel like people are more disciplined than the. the Wild West days that I used to watch them in? Dude, I got in the most arguments. Probably like 90% of my arguments were just with teammates doing things. I'm like, you're not gonna do this on stage. Like, you're griefing us. and our scrim opponents, like, I would literally be like, dude, this team's not going to play against us again if we're doing this, like, this is so ridiculous. Please stop. Yeah. I think that's really funny. And some teams do lose scrim partners, I know if they're trolling too hard. Especially if you're a lower ranked team, it becomes a bit of like a privilege to play the higher ranked teams, you know? they have their scrim bubbles and you can get dropped as a scrim partner if you're trolling too hard because if you're wasting their time on the next one. People talk a lot about that at Worlds and I know there were some teams that were like, oh man. But then the Eastern teams are always gonna beat us in these level ones, and then we're always gonna lose from there. So that's why we have to do this. We have to test our extremes in the level ones and the all-ins. Oh, you really don't know wrong. I think I think for those things to me that it is always stood out as something That's like you don't need to fight to the death level one in a five or six 5 scrim, just get into a custom game and run some level 1s. If you must figure out if GP and Renekton auto attack each other to death at level 1 who wins, then go do it! But like don't waste everyone else's time with it do it in a custom game one-on-one But that stuff is pretty funny. We got a little bit off track, but yeah Immortals Immortals has fun to watch and that has been one of the things that I think has been the biggest pleasant surprise for me is that you know teams like Immortals and Shopify and Dignitas that I didn't really expect a lot from and even 100 Thieves as well. well, who's done even better than that. They're all feeling competitive, even if they are losing. None of the games just feel like this given game where there's a lot usually when you're looking at strength of schedule in previous splits, almost every split, you look through and you're like, okay, well, this is this is like first versus eighth or like this is second versus ninth or whatever you're like, okay, well, that's a guarantee. win, this is a guaranteed win, this is a guaranteed win. When I'm looking at strength of schedule, I don't really feel like that with pretty much any of the games because everyone is kind of at least showing that they can be competitive even if they can't close close. at wins. 100%. I mean, even just looking at the standings, there's no 0-7 team. The worst is 2-5, which, that's super close. Two games between 2nd and 7th. Yeah. And it shows in the game. It's not just like oh, you know This is how it turned out with the with the wins and the losses like there are a lot of really really competitive moments and that's what the conversation about that LCS being a very competitive league this year I feel like just shows up in every single weekend that we have. Yeah and hopefully it will continue being that way. Down in seventh is Shopify and Dignitas, who are both winning one and two this weekend. They're both two and five. Shopify's two wins are against NRG and C9. Again, the worst teams in the league, you know, the easy teams. They both had Sion mid as well, which, I mean... And Udyr top. Mmm, interesting. the tanks? I don't love it. Like, you know, it's kind of what we were saying about TL is like, I don't think just winning in one way is super beneficial to your team, especially when it's I admit it doesn't count and losing with Lucian doesn't count kind of like like kind of kind of I Don't know it just doesn't feel like It kind of feels like you're cheesing them, which not to take away from them, I don't think Shopify is bad by any means. I just think that I would like to see them play a little bit more normal. I don't think you need to try to cheese everyone you ever play. And I would like to see how they do with a more standard game plan. I mean, I think it's fine to have this as one of your strategies. But it can only be one like I was saying earlier if you keep doing the same thing even if it's something that nobody else Is doing people are gonna recognize that pattern and they're going to build counters, specifically for you, like Hundred Thieves did, and dump on you. So you've already, you've already used up your surprise. factor. So unless you have another iteration or you are the one ready with innovations and and corrections to what you think people are going to try and play into you then you're gonna you're really going to lose out because then you become the predictable one and you're kind of making your opponent be the creative one by coming with their counter are already prepared for you so that's my biggest worry I guess for Shopify and the thing that's going to hinge on this week's practice the most how much work they put into actually regaining the surprise factor or the upper hand in them knowing their strategy better than you. do because if you know their strategy just as well as they do and come with a counter then it's going to fail. because I don't think there's anything wrong inherently with just like playing off meta, but I do think I agree in that you can't just play the same thing every time. Like when Insanity last split was playing off meta stuff, he was playing like graves mid and things that were wildly different right so to me it's like if he just wants to be play never play a single game of his year this whole split and he's just gonna play different stuff I think that's fine but if you're just going to be doing the same thing every time, then yeah, people are going to pre-counter it and it's going to become a problem. But it's like if he wants to, if he wants to go from Sion mid and then next week he's playing like Brand and Xerath and, you know, Vel'Koz. and whatever, it's like, okay. I will make the distinction, I think there's a pretty big difference between those kind of like artillery mages and Sion and Garen. Like, you know, no offense to insanity But those are like that's the champ I would put my mid laner on if like he's just worse than and all my opponents, right? Like if I was a jungler and I somehow got auto filled into LCS mid, I'd be like, give me something easy. It's give me something that I will not get rolled over on or I can still be useful. even if I get rolled on, because Sion's not really winning lane against anything. He's just kind of enduring the laning phase and then being useful afterwards. And I know Insanity's a good player. He, if he wants to play innovative picks, great. I have no issue with that. I think it's just like when you're trying to just take the easy way out and pick some non-punishable champions. That's kind of like and I guess I'm gonna get you so far to play devil's advocate Do you still think it's basically like incorrect if their read is just that tank itemization is so That it's actually like this is actually just the best way to play the game. I mean if if they truly believe that then Right, I don't think it's wrong, but I think that that's probably not the case Yeah, and I think they're making their comp worse by also picking the Kassandre and Anatalyst with a Sion game, and then you're running three of these low damage tanks and I mean this example of the hundred thieves game is just the the most like lopsided example that I could pull from because that was a really good drop 100 it's so smart not only is it the Aatrox but they also have the Lilia to annihilate both of them with Liandry's and passive stacking and they have the Ola for sniper it's like every single person and then they back up all these short range melees with a senate tom kensch lane and you're just like oh my god this is the perfect anti-shopify strategy and then they even triple downed on the tanks without damage type of type of build here for them so I feel like the even more self-countered It was it was really interesting though, because I remember even in that game Boogie got what was it three or four early kills on the brand? I can't remember how many but he got some early kills and APA was casting the game and they're they're asking him oh which which team do you think has the better spot and he was like basically saying he thought Shopify was gonna win for sure mm-hmm that he thought they had a better spot the brand was just gonna to win the game, basically. So it's interesting, right? So it's like, even in that game, at least APA still believed that there was a way. I disagree. Yeah, you never believed I disagree watching the game you never believe so I was Maybe it's because I I just have had so many scenarios where you do You get to the point where the champions that are like drain tanks get to run through pure tank teams And Lilia, Aatrox, and Olaf are all those classic of the healing drain tanky do way more damage than a tank but also annihilate them class. They have good ways to actually pressure and kill Brand as well. And you've got a Senna, Tom. Kench too, or even if one of them does get low, you have a Tom Kench and the Senate healing is healing. I was just like, oh my God, this is, this is crazy. I was like damn gold inclusive genius. Yeah, well, we'll see we'll see if Shopify cooks it But anything new this weekend or if they're gonna continue on the tank train didn't toss the last team and down at 1 and 2 this weekend you know their team I feel like I still would say they're overperforming expectations but I think they're the team that people have the least hope for, I don't know if you guys agree with that? Really? I was actually going to say, I have them up there with 100 Thieves as far as surpassing my expectations. Because I think even though Dick hasn't been winning a lot of their games, they're competitive. They're playing a pretty good game, even when they don't manage to win. Exu has impressed me a lot. almost every game he's going for some kind of early invade, like take my raptors, walk into your jungle, scrap with the enemy jungle. Axe here's been really good. And I know going back to our jungle. 8th on the jungle tier list, and I was pitching XU. Yeah, but it's not like 8th means he's bad. It just means everyone's good, and somebody's got to be 8th, and I haven't seen him enough. but he's been really impressive to me. Did he move up in the tier list? What's the updated power ranking for Axew? Dude, I want to put more people in the same tier. It's... Eighth to eighth. That's a new update. No, I'd maybe move him up, but who else is gonna be eighth in, I don't know, man. But he's been good. He's been really good, especially for a new player. I like the confidence. he plays with. Obviously not perfect, he makes some mistakes, like anybody, but I just like watching the way they play. They've been kind of doing their own thing with picks as well. just sticking to one style but I think this is actually a team that I have I have hope for I think that you think they go up I don't think there's any match dig is gonna to go into where I'm like yeah they're just gonna get rolled there's I don't feel about any team I don't feel like that for any team which is yeah comes back to like the the competitive LCS split that we're having but yeah I guess Immortals and Dig are the two examples of coming into the split where pretty much everybody's you're just so used to like oh yeah those are throws away games. I definitely agree with you. I don't feel like that for Immortals games anymore. I don't feel like that for Dignitas games at all. I will say one thing I'm kind of disappointed with, and maybe this is coloring my perception a little bit, is that I had higher expectations for Rich. I thought Rich was actually really good last split, or last year I guess it was overall. This split I feel like he hasn't been performing really as well he's not been nearly as much of a standout for me so I feel like Dove and x you and stuff I've definitely performed compared to where I expected but I felt like we're just kind of underperformed and I I guess I struggled to see them climbing the standings I do think that they're competitive but yeah you also think Dove has overperformed expectations? Well, I feel like people's expectations for him was that he was going to be really trash. So yeah, I would say so. OK. I mean, is that wrong? I feel like everyone was flaming this guy when Dignitas announced the pickup. Yeah, I guess people only... yeah. People were telling me that he's like not even like not even deserving to be... be in any tier one league period, let alone, let alone like be a decent midlaner in a tier one league. Yeah, I mean it's tough to say, I guess I hadn't heard much about him at all good or bad yeah which you know from a lot of people I've talked to is kind of similar so I think he's done all right you know nothing crazy he's had some standout performances like some good plays also some some ints but I don't have any strong opinion on him either way yet. One thing interesting is that Rich hasn't played any Udyr, and I know he's lost against Udyr a lot, so. What's really weird about that is he was one of the ones spamming it in champs queue too. So I was coming in this thinking that they were going to have a high priority on it and they just haven't so i yeah i also thought that was weird um he also hasn't like last year he was doing counterpicks and all these like lane bully counterpicks yeah quite a lot of stuff yeah that I was kind of hoping for for a bit more especially because the way They changed top lane this year where it's harder to gank, you know, you're more isolated I was like, oh This is gonna be even better for Dignitas and Rich's style of let me get a kind of isolated counter pick Vayntop has been pretty popular in solo queue also stuff like that you know where you're you're gonna try and be abusive I don't know and isolated but We had Aatrox, Gragas, Rumble, Ornn, Poppy, and Gnar. Gnar, the Gnar one I think was a counterpick Gnar, which had the possibilities. of being cool but I don't think that chance very good atrox is another one that's kind of looking like a bait pick at this point he's lost like really I love the profane Hydra I feel like it does bad in every game. I'm with you man. I think Aatrox has been looking awful in top lane I think I don't know if the champions like insane or not. I think people might be building him into like the profane hydra lethality in situations where you might not want that. I think there are times where it's good, you know, if you're really ahead, but if it's the default that you're going to every single game. Because I see so many fights where Aatrox just goes in and just gets one shot. And that's not very good. Especially there have been a lot where they have. have no tank jungle and no tank support I thought every time there's there's that scenario you should be the bruiser build hey you need your entry Fragger you need like The guy who just goes in, like, before it works well with Goredrinker, but like, now you can kind of do it with like Sundered Sky, Sterak's type items. Like you need someone who can just go in, tank their spells. and hopefully not instantly die. Yeah, I mean to me Aatrox is getting picked all the time as an answer into Udyr. They just build Lethality, lose lane generally. or go even at best into Udyr. And then they have this like super tank on the other side that's just running around, slowing everyone, stunning everyone. Aatrox never feels like it's getting those highlight moments. There's so much peel in the game I feel like right now as well that it's very difficult for him to without setup like you guys are talking about. So I don't know. I mean maybe it's a build thing, maybe it's just a matchup thing. Maybe it's just an Udyr is so strong thing, but like you know Udyr and Aatrox are on two opposite ends of the spectrum as far As how top lane picks are performing. Udyr is 83% win rate, Aatrox is 22% win rate in the LCS and yeah I just feel like Udyr has been looking way and one of those Aatrox games is mid Aatrox from quid. This is specifically top. highlighted on top because like there there have been some good atrox picks but yeah they have been a lot fewer and and usually the ones i like are when they do have engage from jungle or support. Yeah, the wins have been from Castle and Immortals, too. Yeah, that's it. Everyone else who's tried Aatrox has lost. And I think, like you were saying, Armaeo. does play that like tanky engage style which obviously is going to enable Aatrox a lot better than some other stuff. Yep, well it's been a really fun split so far I've been enjoying it a lot I hope that that we keep up the competitiveness. I hope that it's not just one of those things where it's just like, okay, and everything went back to how you expected it, right? In the second half, but it's gonna be fun.

Yeah, you're not allowed welcome to waiting room. Oh, we're back and we are turtle And it's just like that, it just turns on. How have you been? Great, how are you? I've seen you around with Shopify. Shopify has been great. switching the team, hanging out on the sidelines, losing week one, you know, it was good. You forgot to mention one thing. What? It was your damn birthday yesterday! Yes! It was, it was. I'm 29 now. Let's go! You're old as hell! Woo! I love that picture. Yeah, it's really funny. What'd you end up doing yesterday? I don't know, just hanging out, watching a movie, just chilling, eating dinner, going to sleep. I don't know. Okay, so you're more low-keepers. Because for me, I just don't generally tell people when it's my birthday, and I do. nothing. I don't really celebrate my birthday, I just play video games. Historically I just play video games and just, you know, have a blast playing League or something. There's some tape online, though, of what else you've been up to. Yes. Yes. It's a video Shopify film for us. Check it out. Let's go. Quickly, a meal. We challenged WildTurtle and Tomio to grocery shop with a $25 budget, but what they didn't know was that they had to make a meal out of their purchases. Let the best shopper win. Alright, let's get a basket Yeah, specifically blueberries, why are these ones so large? They're like GMO. You know, I'm just gonna get roasted turkey Call me weird if you'd like. Part of the challenge is to make a meal out of your materials. You have 20 minutes, and your time starts now. I'm gonna put them down individually. And that's it, guys. And guys, ladies and gentlemen, the final product. Hello everybody, it's me, Mr. Turtle, and here is my dish. the wild turkey. The thing about a pumpkin chocolate chip is, well, I just wanted to get some chocolate chips at the grocery store, and the raspberries, a great source of fiber and vitamin C and you know this blueberry that's GMO'd out of its mind so I'm sure it's also pretty good. I got the proteins from the clif bar and let me know what you think We'll see you next time. was getting. I thought it was chocolate chip. It just happened to be pumpkin. You ate it, right? Yeah, I ate all of it. It was fine. It was okay. I just didn't expect it to be pumpkin flavored. trip. I would not be a good trip. I knew it was over when you spent half of your budget on coffee. Oh, I didn't realize we had to like make food. It was a bait-and-switch. Yeah, it was a bait-and-switch. Yes anyways new patch we'll see what teams have been cooking up because we are on the live patch for the only professional league major region in the world that will be on 14.3 and see that little dragon That's Smolder. I see him. Oh. Smolder. We can play Smolder. Today? Today. Nice. Teams can play Smolder or Aurelion Sol. Hotfix Aurelion Sol.  But they've had just as much time to adjust to this stuff as the people at home. into it. Year of the Dragon, something like that. Yeah. Dragonfist Lee Sin. Let's look at the patch notes. Let's look at the overview of what's happened so far because obviously small has been released. Aesol had a bunch of changes. Karma Ezreal nerfed. What stands out, Emily, to you so far in the patch? Xer is back, or she might be back. I mean, she's kind of getting picked in some outlier cases, and then obviously, I'm not going to necessarily take what happens. happened in NACL yesterday, because they were actually the first minor development league on the patch. But they're also inferior. list draft so it makes sense. This is obviously one of our best very players in the league right now in Berserker and people are kind of wondering with the Zeri buffs to this patch, whether it is enough to see something like this out of C9, because historically this has been a champion on win. Berserker has been able to showcase his teamfighting prowess as you see she had base 8 debuffs and a cooldown reduction on for ultimate so um I mean I think Zeri was kind of getting picked in outlier situations anyway with the metric Like, ton of bot-linked bans we've seen across the board. We have a solid bust, but also I think the items, like the Kraken Slayer and the Static Shiv is a good pick. actually a really good addition to. Statikk Shiv losing 300 gold on the purchase price is pretty amazing to get for her. And you want to build that early on, Terry? Yeah, you just get it, and then you can. farm even faster than before. A little questionable about the hex play. I don't know if it's a good item on Ziri quite yet, but I prefer getting Navori second still, so. You think she's in a good spot right now? Yeah. I always kind of liked Zarya. I don't know if anyone's been watching my streams, but I play Zarya like 24-7 almost. Oh, then you're perfect for this. If she ends up coming out. Like, it's going to be interesting with a lot of, I guess, newer things being thrown bot lane overall. Like, yes, we already talked about Smolder coming through, a weaker laner overall. And I wonder if people are going to prioritize the pick and if they can protect it to me the patch Changes that I'm interested in is actually like the karma nerfs because She was thrusted into the meta with pretty large ratio changes to make her pretty difficult to deal with, at least in the drafts, because people expected her to be able to do that. immediately that they would be playing Karma mid with malignants, maybe even like top lane. But a lot of teams ended up flexing it to the bot lane with Ezreal and so the buffs to Ezreal. The buff to certain items, like, uh, to, like, I guess the, um, Essence Reaver items in the previous patch, like, it made it so, oh, suddenly it's just a really good lane to play. Yeah. I think she is still in a good spot. I still think it's really difficult to draft against a team that's willing to three-way flex the karma. So even though it did hit her, I think she's still in a good spot. Yeah, I think last- week Karma was more banned than picked. We only saw it bot lane but it was banned in almost every game so I don't think Karma or Ezreal are necessarily dead. Like when I look at the win rate. rate and magnitude on the stats sites that you see online. They didn't do that much to move the needle down, especially if teams were practicing it last week. Really quickly, we have the graphic now. I want to put it up. pull up the full patch notes to give a brief overview of the number of changes and the number of items that are actually hit, because Turtle, you already mentioned that the itemization is gonna be changing things. So you can see like the system changes up at the top right, huge amounts of item changes, decent amount of nerfs, a lot of buffs, some of the adjustments they say adjustments where they're not really sure what's gonna happen. Oh my god, the Illaoi ones are buffs, guys. I'm sorry. It turns out to be a massive buff, like the Maokai one as well only hit his win rate by like one percent, so I think Olai's still going to be a support. there. One thing I want to zero in on though, you can see up in the bus it goes Asol, Nidalee, and then Pike, Buccio. So Buccio, if you want... player of the week last week, so he was riding a high. He gained some followers on social media by basically saying that he will pick Pike if he gets to 10,000. He got to 10,000. There it is. And he had this to say. He's gonna pick Pyke, right? So much for 10,000 followers on Twitter. Hope you guys are excited to see Pyke this weekend Again, hope you guys are excited as you bike. These are the pike changes. A lot of line items. I think overall it's a, for me, a fairly minor buff. The E damage going up is much lower. later in the game, so I don't think that's going to have a massive impact. I'm actually just a little curious. Turtle, as the coach. Shot fired belly. Do you like that they're maybe sleeping on Shopify a little bit, saying they're gonna play Pyke, making mean videos about it? Is that the task at hand to beat Shopify Rebellion today? I mean, I do hope they... I don't know if this champion is that good, it did receive some buffs, the W one is pretty big actually. I think this movement speed is actually pretty large, but yeah I hope they do pick Pyke and we can punish it all I'm saying was I was watching some solo queue games I saw an elo Pyke and solo queue I'm just putting it out there people are practicing it okay trying to make the case to nuke duck, a few supports just want to pick it because it's fun. And also the buffs look nice. I mean he is really fun though, it's like really hard to kill and you can just kind of walk wherever. you want, take all the wards, it's pretty enjoyable. And I will be unfollowing Busio if he doesn't pick Pyke, because that was the deal, he said if he gets 10,000 followers he's going to lock it in, so he better do it. This week!  disabled due to a visual bug. It was introduced in 14.3. We asked League Ops because we want to describe it. They said, we're not telling you because we don't want you doing solo queue. So just know that we're not gonna see Niko. I wanted to abuse the bug. That's all we know, we just don't know. In addition to the patch changes, remember Smolder is now enabled in the LCS, so let's check in with Jan and Masu for a rundown on Smolder. Hey guys, it's John from Team Liquid. Hey, I'm Masu, FlyQuest's ADC. And here's some Smolder tips. The very noob-friendly tech with Smolder these days... is Comet, Manaflow Bands, Absolute Focus, Scorch. This is very easy to get out of lane, because in my opinion, Smolder is a very good pick. scaling champion. He's not very a lane heavy dominant champion where you want to like brute force and duel people and fight them. I thought his laning phase should be pretty weak but then People discovered that you can just start W and go Comet and start Doran's Ring And now I'm not so sure if his lane is weak When the lane comes out like this, your main goal is to push the wave as much as you can, because your cooldowns are very long, and hit them as well as you can. So, let's say they're here, then you want to. be here if they're like here you want to move a little bit and push like this but in this case you push like that and then you have a really decent wave clear so you can just do this and because of how wide it is and how hard it is to miss, you're basically guaranteed to hit somebody in lane, which gives you a stack. And keep in mind, you don't, in my opinion, you don't want to auto-trade that much because you You don't have like a high AD with this. There's always one secret mechanic that people fail to recognize. Like one very small, very, very small one, like a lot. people will use this is like you can like glitch out of the wall anytime like let's say i'm hovering this wall you can like keep glitching back and forth towards the end So you can, like, utilize how much you're actually hitting them here, like, one, two, and then leave at the end, because it actually ended here, you know? I tried to, like, see their numbers in-game, see how they're doing. how strong they actually are early game, how hard do they scale into late game, and how easy is it to transition? I think the damage is very strong, but I don't like that. and we'll lose a lot of duels. I think how much his ult does was pretty surprising at first. Because if you hit the center at like level 6 it does close to like 300 damage. I think the ultimate is very strong, like, look how far it goes. Meow. Mom. These are my thoughts, thanks for watching. Smolder. Are we going to see Smolder? That's kind of all chat wants to know. We'll for sure see Smolder. For sure. For sure. You're guaranteeing it. He has some squirmly.  Oh, I do have scrim links, that's why. banned out. But we did see a bunch of smolder in the NACL yesterday. Specifically, smolder mid seemed to end up being more successful. then smolder of like the sample size um but teams were more than willing to lock it in because once you hit 225 stacks you actually just over the game. Yeah, and when I was looking at some of just the solo queue data, there are a lot of optimizations with the champion. Like being able to know the damage of your Q. to stack faster is a massively important optimization. So depending on your ELO, so like basically the highest winner was Diamond, emerald, then gold, then silver, in terms of how good you are at smolder. So even the diamond I saw is already up over 50% for a new champion, which to me is like, all right. Yeah, like we're almost certainly gonna see it once I once I see that I personally don't know all the optimizations yet But what were you gonna say? Yeah, I was about to say cuz like with the filming that we had right there there was actually it was last last week when it just released exactly so I'm sure their opinions have changed on this one even to the point of like the rune changes like for me I saw PTA has a pretty nice room because Q procs PTA at least it has one single proc on it So you can auto Q auto and you can get the PTA proc instantly. So like what's your experiences off a plane? After playing Smolder myself too, I think the Meteor build is just more OP, just because when you land that first W in lane it's just like 170 damage, and it's near impossible to miss like that. W is just, you're a noob if you're missing it, I'm sorry, but it's pretty easy to land right now. And if you hit champions, you get a stack. Yeah, you get a stack too, so that's a strong point. like three points in W and the max in Q, so that's pretty popular right now. Because one thing I did learn, and I'm sure everyone probably knows this by now, but once you're three points W. and you have 25 stacks of Q, you W the back wave Q once you get three stacks, every single time. So you push fast, you get stacks fast. Emily, you'd mentioned that you could possibly get Mike. pretty sure you can do the same thing because like we were watching lec earlier and we're whoa senna got a lot of souls off the mites basically i'm pretty sure each of those counts as a stack. Yeah, the little baby tiny Krugs all give you a stack as well, so you can go kill Krugs and get like 8 or 10. But at the end of the day, it's like 20 minutes until you're at 225 stacks. It's really hard. Like when do you fight? No, I think like at least for the scrims I've been watching too. It takes around like 25-26 minutes to get like fully stacked too and there's a lot of action so when you get pulled away from, you know, farming the creeps, it can be kind of hard. And how weak are you before 26? I personally think it's a pretty weak champion. It's like, it specializes in like, kind of like zone control. and just getting like a good ultimate. Mm-hmm. Man. It's gonna be tough. I think Fleet is decent, but the comet build makes sense. Yeah, I don't know if Fleet's that great. Maybe I need to play a little bit more. It's just like sustain. It's just like depending on how rough you think the laning phase is going to be. You think it's going to go any other lane? Because you're right about there being a lot of people trying mid lane. I actually, when I was watching and doing a lot of my research, I was like watching Nemesis and he thinks it's broken, but also he's just playing it a lot through mid. Sure. So it's interesting. to know that it's just, it can be used as a flex pick and I think that will teeter it over to being abused in competitive if people are willing to flex it as much as they want. think it's good. When I was checking the stats, highest solo queue win rate was bot, and then it was about 3% lower in mid and in top. But Lorlo has been streaming it a lot. in top against like melee matchups and he's like oh you get to scale for free and he's like he's still pretty bad at it like if you watch him in teamfights he's just running he knows he is Yeah, he's running around doing dumb things just kind of having fun and he's still actually finding a decent amount of success Because a lot of those games get derpy is doing 25 stacks and it's like he accidentally kills people like once get to 225 steps. You really do. You just press Q. The spray is so wide. I hope we see it so we can see once you get to 225. because the difference and the amount of damage you do is just insane yeah I think we should have like a counter to see who's gonna get the fastest over a fast five category. Okay let's check out the standings as we move in to the second half of the spring split regular season fly quest two games clear of the pack at six and one. We got a lot of 4-3 teams. Immortals, 3-4, 3 games out of 1st. That's one more game out of 1st than they were last week. And Shopify and Dig in 7th place. One IMT so far today. Always have to mention how Immortals is doing because a lot of people thought they're gonna be last. And look, they're not last. Anyway, scheduled today. They could be last if things don't go well. because they play up against Dignitas in game two. Obviously, we got the championship rematch once again. Energy versus Cloud9 in game one. Turtle will be joining the cast for that one. So definitely check it out and Shopify Rebellion versus FlyQuest, who I am really curious to see who WildTurtle picked in that game, but we'll see that at the waiting room. So. The top story though, last week, as we saw from the standings there, is there's this like super team? I heard we had like a super team in the LCS? I heard a little bit. Yeah, I heard they were cloud nine. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but first I messed up the toss We got to take a look what we've got on deck this week Smolder. Smolder? Smolder, smolder, smolder. Smolder! Smolder? Smolder, Smolder! Smolder! Smolder! Smolder! Smolder! Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, stop! Okay. Smolder. Oh, smaller. Good point. Yeah. Makes sense. Yeah. Mom! We're getting into the second half of the round robin the biggest shocker we have is cloud nine being fixed. Castle coming around from the side, Blabbering slides into the backline, Mudge is here in the front, he's not going to be taken down just yet as Castle kills Blabber, Fudge dropping low, JoJo's dropping lower, oh they got him! Immortals are crushing Cloud9! SideQuest are absolutely steamrolling them, it's five dead bodies from Cloud9's shields! And Cloud9, their fourth straight loss. I'll just say it's C9. Oh, yeah. So. It's banger. Yeah, like. A little rough for them, for sure. They're a little bit. lost in this awesome draft and they're not actually working as a unit to like get wins they're just playing their own champions and hoping the game works out after this game maybe should just stick to fortnight Woo! FlyQuest, they're loving it, man. Their jerseys are like the holographic Pokemon card. And these guys are charizarding the league right now. Five. And one as Masu's gonna have to flash out of there. There's the heartbreaker from xuxu trying to finish them off But Masu is fighting out. Masu is still alive and on the other side. It's Jensen taking over over the fight, Berserker under pressure, having a flash away, but Buccio is ready to follow, Berserker is barely hanging on, but he gets buried underneath the anchor, Berserker and Volt. Dying in the 2v2, Masu makes sure he gets them both. Here comes the damage, and oh, the ulti by Niko pops up. The Kalista, and he gets taken down. taken down, and it will be pushed back and the Emperor's Divide multiplies the kills and it's a triple, heading on over to Basu. Our number one team in the LCS. 2024, looking to be their year. Hello, and welcome back. I am going to start because we're going to kind of go around the table here at the elevator. CS Lounge and talk about what's going on with C9. So I picked draft because it's the thing that everyone is talking about. It's the thing that everyone is always talking about. of their team comps and wins. I think this NRG one right off the bat the last time these two teams faced they're going to face each other again today is kind of the point. platonic ideal of what this C9 team can do with flabber on a carry, Jojo holding mid, you have a pushing Varus, and then maybe Fuzz doesn't like it, but he was one of the best U-Deer players in terms of understanding what to proxy, when to get to the rest of the team. They also had a really nice nocturne and orientation. Ariana combination there and then we're going to go team comps and losses because that's actually what everyone wants to talk about. Yep. This one. I actually will defend the Vayne mid. This was into the Sion as my sleeves always troll me here. But, I think the big thing with a lot of these compositions is that it comes down to execution, so obviously there's a bot lane play with these two that went not so great in that draft and then I think the one that everyone is kind of talking about because with C9 IMT I actually thought it was because Because IMT very smartly picked Ezreal and Bard into this lane. actually thought that was a really nice as well as the ivern was just constantly negating whatever tris wanted to do in mid um so that's more of an execution and then the big thing here is I think everyone kind of finds this draft as the most egregious one. And for me, it's actually not about the Lucian or the Milio. It's about how this draft works into what TL had, which was a massive range. advantage with zigs here um so i think like for me it's less about these drafts in a vacuum and a lot more about execution, and then also what they are picking them into. Because in the TL thing, even if you are giving that draft a... and you're like, we have players that can execute this. I think it's a lot more difficult to execute than what TL had. And I think for me, a lot of the clues. for why they have struggled on stage showed up in early weeks and I I'm not surprised that this ended up happening the way it did so let's just let's just go back a little bit and look at their goal graphs in their wins and their losses. They're very one-dimensional games, right? Like everything in the wins is up and to the right and the majority of the things in the losses are down and to the right. because this one Immortals game they just ended up getting outscaled and that was like probably their most competitive game but what I mean what I mean to show here is that they're very one-dimensional games they started off very well in the first three games, they lost the last four. And I think the drafts are one part of it because they're picking highly early game. you're gonna run over a team type drafts and that worked for three games but when you make mistakes with that it goes very poorly so really quickly I have one example of just like just to remind people here's one where it worked out well right so their their first game against 100 thieves a gank in the top lane against sniper they get a 2v2 double kill and then right afterwards as you can see they even chunk out quid and like you can actually just straight up win a game off of a play like this. And it's basically Fudge froze the lane in the right spot, Blabber knew they were winning the 2v2, they kind of just hands diffed the opponents, but this is like a 2000 gold swing, as well as about half level on everyone, but this also had the bad side of it. One example was bot lane against FlyQuest, this happened last week, it got completely blown open because Boosteel landed the nice hook onto Berserker, Berserker was in too aggressive of a spot, they killed both of them, they ran it back, they killed both of  again and then because they don't have that many tools they ended up just getting snowballed out of the game. So the long-winded way of saying this... is, I roughly went through all seven of their games and tried to see what their tendencies were, and... This isn't gonna be 100% accurate because this was just my opinion, but to me, they had better scaling in one of seven games. They had equal scaling in one of the games, which is why I have 1.5. I thought they picked pushing lanes in 17 of 21 possible pushing lanes, which is ridiculous. And the hands-diff definition would be where Where did I think they straight out outplayed or got outplayed? And this one would be too low for the amount of talent they have on this team because when you're picking these win lane comps. You actually need to consistently hands-diff the other team to be able to get wins. So they're not picking themselves tools I think it's because they're running over people in scrims. They're not getting the same leads on and that's why we're in this current predicament. Another thing that I would mention is also just the bot, bot lane died that they had against Shaman. Bye bye overall. So the play that I wanted to showcase for us. Oh sorry I believe your mic died Raz so he's been talking to us I promise but now he's got a hot mic The botched dive against Shots of My Rebellion, and then on top of that, what you mentioned, the 2v2. This is another example, the most recent example, versus Team Liquid, where they're going up against a Rift or a Play. Can you guys hear me at the time? I'll just keep going. So we just roll this here. As we just roll this here, the mistake has already been made. here. As you look at the minimap, we have eyes on Udyr on mid wave and as you can already see, both APA and Umti are challenging Jojo Pyeon in blind on the Rift Herald. So a mistake has already been made when both Vulcan and Berserker are opening up on CoreJJ and split themselves. The TP is coming in from Gnar, but he is going to be here as you can see. So the ideal play for Berserker, Vulcan, and Jojopion are to walk up. So he's able to participate in the play. It's going to be difficult for Impact to even come in. He has to walk up. walk through the Gnar to make it happen and as I clear the screen and just show you what ends up happening, they walk away from the Gnar, easier access from impact to be able to just maul the back line of Cloud9. nine and as you can tell fudge comes into the play too late. So first thing that I wanted to focus on is if you're committing to the rift herald and you're man down you must commit as a team and walk away as a unit but if you're gonna take the fight you have to involve fudge in the play and we've seen it in basically every game where botches so those are things that we need to look look at when they come into this game, which is as simple as execution. All right, we're gonna be sending it to stage in a minute, but first let's check out the predictions. Wild Turtle, you can go up there because you gotta get ready to cast. Oh yeah. But yeah, let's check out the predictions for today. All of us saying C9 is going to bounce back. Let's go turn it off. Wow, we are boring today. Standing by your team. Discord with a 1% edge for energy in this game. But the the cloud nine faith runs strong here apparently and wild turtle could not go against his team to the discord for actually going for NRG. It's a 51% so just a bit, but at least we got some value. Alright, that's it from here at the lounge. Let's send it out to the casters. to get in to game one. Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching!   You Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the LCS here in spring 2024. A happy Lunar New Year to all y'all. to have some more fun here. It's Saturday, we're kicking off the second round robin of this split and we're doing it with another rematch. Energy versus C9. I'm Captain Flowers here with Kobe and WildTurtle. We got the reigning champs looking to stand tall in a rematch against that super team now in free fall. After that, Dig and Immortals are going. head-to-head in a battle to climb the standings in this split where anybody can take down anybody. Game number three of the day is gonna see the battle in the top lane with the new generation of NA talent squaring up against the old guard of the LCS as longtime rivals 100 Thieves and Team Liquid throw down. Finally we're gonna wrap it all up with the match. scientists of the LCS having to cook up something truly special if they're gonna take down one of the strongest teams in the league for Shopify versus FlyQuest. I'm Flowers, that's Kobe, this is Turtle. Turtle. Gentlemen, let's do it. Let's do it. And a happy delayed birthday. Yesterday was Wild Turtles birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday, buddy. A present. I got you a cast with me and flowers Yeah, yeah, yeah, and hopefully these guys are gonna bring you some top-level gameplay here for this Remember the first time that we saw these two teams go head-to-head? to kick off the split, it was pretty one-sided, and it was one-sided Cloud9's way. I was talking to Cloud9 members because they were just in makeup at the same time as me and I was going over patch notes and I was like, oh they buffed Zeri! And Berserker's like, we're gonna win worlds! His favorite champion! So fingers crossed, you know, maybe they'll get their hands on Zary or maybe the smolder as well Yeah, I think so. I feel like it is a scale is so good because you can get to your 225 stacks pretty early in the game at least by 20 minutes most people have been able to do it yeah We did see last week as well, you know, a tiny bit of Darius coming out, Wippo trying his hand at it So maybe it's made its way through the scrims Well still one band to go on cloud 9 side They could just take that off the table if they want to I feel like if energy is gonna ban out Darius They're kind of saying yeah, we will slam out here. If you don't ban it, but see now I'm gonna focus on the Twisted Fate instead. So Twisted Fate, Ashe, Ivern, banned out by C9. NRG getting rid of the Tristana, the Ori, and the Darius. Dougla with the classic hover of his action keeping us in suspense for the first pick and it is that Udyr priority Who could have guessed? Yo, we also looked at the You know, in the Cloud9 victories, two of the three games were Fudge on the Udyr. It's just a champion that is so useful pushing up into enemy jungle and taking over territory. Looking we're still have this magnifying glass on the bottom lane. I feel like cloud9 have their have their pick here for berserker All right, do they go ahead and lock in this Varus? Yes, they will. Okay, this is something that I was kind of hoping to see some of. It's not Lucian for C9. They definitely had some rough performance. on that they're gonna put Berserker back on the Varus what is Vulcan gonna play next to him to ensure some 2v2 success here that's what I'm wondering Looks like they might be going for the answer into the Udyr first. To me, I haven't been a huge fan of the Kassadin into the Udyr, but there are a lot of magic resistance. first items you can rush now yeah hollow radiance helps you with wave clear and is decent magic resist for the for the Phoenix form so a lot of people have been going that route route and just having Casante as the answer for later. They just got out of their practice tools, everyone was practicing up. A couple of special matchups here and getting the hype ready. So we've got the Senna locked in. in here for energy FBI and who he not shy at all about playing the center Tom Kench if it's a draft where they feel like it's a good pick to go with let's see if they want to go ahead and lock in that second half or if they have some even spicier plan to pair with the Senna yep I wouldn't be surprised at all there it is TK locked in how do you feel about Senna TK lanes compared to the traditional ones well Senna's got like a new build right now she doesn't go like the support item anymore like as the first item so she's probably gonna start the D blade and start farming a little bit and potentially buying the support item on the first base but okay I've seen it being skipped overall too, so we'll see. If you were playing for Cloud9, what would you want to pair with? Berserker's Varus into a Senna Tahm Kench that lane has so much healing. Yeah, it's a little bit difficult to find a good support I think Milia would be a decent one. Maybe potentially Renado as well so that's probably what I would go for yeah Renata definitely has a good counter engage. Renata or the Milio. They might also want some engage. Yeah, also important to keep an eye on what's gonna get banned out the way banned out by c9 thinking okay Maybe they've got some sort of some way tech cooking up against the Azir here in mid lane. The Azir was locked in before we got to the second half of the band so we'll see what energy wants to look at here. The Orianna remember was already fanned out in the first half. the draft. Taliyah players, so it could be a big flex pick for them Jungle slash mid lane and Taliyah is very commonly a pick into the Azir. Azir has a lot of energy Now since it's the most picked champion. Yeah, but the Taliyah definitely is an option there They might take the Corki, but Corki just got nerfed recently. So yeah, there's a potential The interaction between Eclipse and Malignant is being removed so you don't just automatically get the proc with a single rocket. Akali banned out. Karma, who's now a multi-flex pick. banned out, Hui that can often be played in mid lane, sometimes other places but you mostly see him mid, banned out. Lots of mid focus but the final one will be that Melio one of the options you were talking about that could be a good pairing with the... The Renata is still there. We'll see if C9 wants to go for that. They still have to pick both that support and jungle. Which one are they going to leave for last, my guess? would be support. Counter-pick definitely has a lot more value there, but we're already seeing the whole bottom lane here with the Senna TK, so they lock it in. Wow. Now, Bard has been going with a super tanky build too, so it's one of the most annoying supports for the rest of the map right now. Getting out there, and we'll see if Vulcan... can actually split up his time and try and help out with the grubs, try and help out Blabber in controlling the rest of the map early on. Energy were one of the classic combos of having Powerfox on a kill-oriented mage when you combine it with the Vi, and that's the one I was talking about, the Taliyah buffs. coming in. I know both these players love this champion and when you have a Vi, guaranteed setup for the seismic shove for Taliyah. That's a classic kill. combo for energy it's like whoa let's see we've been already good here it's good mix of this if c9 wants to go for it they could lock it in is Roni yeah and come on they wanted to burn it all down Brandon gets some pretty substantial nerfs. They didn't completely like kill the champion or anything, but it did bring them a lot more in line. They slowed down the clear a little bit with some of the brand nerfs on this patch and so. Blabber gonna go with another tank. Cloud9 have not had great success with him on tanks so far this season. Yeah, they got all their wins when he was... On you know DPS type of champions But they are gonna have a very very beefy frontline especially a Vulcan also builds tanky, you know Cloud9 with very much a two threat composition here. So Turtle, let me ask you, seeing all ten champions locked in, which one of these drafts would you rather be playing? I personally would rather be playing on energy. I just think it's much easier to execute, like the Vi into the Taliyah combo is just very easy. Udyr has prio, I think Voli is going to have prio too. So it seems like they have two shoving lanes. and a Taliyah that can run to either, I would give the early game to energy right now for the comp. you know, the ball in your court, so to speak, and NRG, they're the ones that have a lot of the options for proactive moves. You know, Udyr top side too, should have full control there. So, contracts of power. Fox are definitely set up in this game to be the ones to make some early moves try and get those early kills and then later on even if Vi goes too deep you have a Tahm Kench on your team to save her as well, so I feel like they have a really good way to execute on teamfights. Cloud9 though, obviously, really good scaling there with the Inferior, so they also... Let's count out the Zir. All right, is that what you're doing if you're Cloud9? Because what I'm about to ask you is, you guys are giving me the whole movie trailer for this energy protagonist moment here. What if you do with your C9? What do you do if you're trying to stop this loss streak and respond to this draft? I think for C9 they just have to get JoJo in like a comfortable position. Okay, potentially push waves and get the free farm. I think when Azir gets one or two items he can definitely hold on to the game for them. where this team has kind of inexplicably begun to free fall. They have had a lack of proactive plays, and in this game it seems like that might be the case. case again of course they do have Bard and they do have Sejuani who can make some action early so maybe they'll be able to get something going definitely need to have take a little bit more more control than they have so far this season, though. All right, let's get into it, see what goes down. Cloud9 trying to fight back after a disa- Astro is super weak. I believe we have the numbers for how long it's been since this team has lost five games in a row, 2,700. 174 days that's seven point something years a very very long time But energy you have the opportunity to make that a reality here today you guys have already been talking about how you expect energy to be able to control the early game and c9 is going to have to find some sort of response here because you can see their upcoming schedule is not going to be easy. Definitely does not get easier from here. They did win the first time this season though, versus NRG, the first game of the entire season. split was a cloud nine victory back in the beginning when they were still a super team we'll see how super they're feeling after this one gonna have a lot of eyes on this bottom lane in particular. Berserker and Vulcan when Berserker throughout a lot of last year the year before was being talked about as just the bar for mechanical excellence. in the AD carry role. Him and Vulcan having some rough laning phases and tough 2v2s last week, as Doke was just trying to annoy these guys. The awakened glacial attack from Udyr is. very obnoxious. Blaber losing some extra HP there. Even though it was a 2v1 defense, Dokla can still trade pretty even. Yeah, the North American Udyrs have been really, really good at this, constantly starting to get a lot of Starting out to invade enemy jungle, getting them a little bit behind. There's some early bot action. Oh, yep, he's hungry, but Vulcan can get away. There we go, one last lick. And stunned. Alright turtle walk us through the early stages from the point of view from the Senate Tom Kench Well for them. They just want to like keep the wave push. Oh, they're gonna go for an all-in right here, too Yeah looks like it, Berserker taken low, Vulcan even lower, below 200 HP there on the support as Energies duo immediately establishes control. Yeah, NRG just has to maintain this control now, the lane is pretty much over, I don't see how Bard-Barrick is going to get back into this one. Alright, constant push on. bottom side. Sejuani is pathing down towards bottom and Contractz actually just did his red quadrant and is coming for an invade here. Okay let's see if he runs into black. What sort of jungle violence we get here in this blue side quadrant for C9 instead They may just try to turn it into a dive the wave about to crash into the turret Vulcan and Berserker hitting level two contracts coming in looks for the ball breaker and he breaks Vulcan's jaw now Berserker under the pressure next a little bit more damage is required It's some goofy plays coming out from energy as who he just barely gets away from the turret shot It ends up being a one-for-one trade. Yeah contract Just needed to back out and like reset the tower aggro there. Oh Berserker, he's about to drop. Oh, he's going in what about the Flashes he missed Oh, there's frog legs for dinner. Goodbye, goodnight, Berserker gets paid and FBI drops again. Energy, I don't even know what. What the hell that was, as Doakla versus Fudge continues with the 1v1 in the top side, but Doakla's fast enough to get away. It's a 3-1 game before 4 minutes. We wanted we were looking for cloud 9 to bounce back and have some early moves. It actually is fully reactive though It's not them being proactive on the plays. It's it's energy, kind of spoofing the dive here. Now, the first kill is perfect. It's just that when he goes for a little bit more here. Back out. Yeah, definitely. You either got to just commit to it and and get the kill on berserker under tower and sacrifice your life there Because they had the ward up by blue buff to see the path down from blabber but then yeah once who he goes off in for it it's very difficult to re-dive unless you reset the tower aggro so yeah it was a pretty hasty play from Contrax there And I think I love the fact that you brought it up. It was reactive Kobe. This is one of those ones that energy They full force the whole situation and now they're gonna suffer the consequences for it still only about a 500 gold lead for C9 so not like they lost massive minion waves or anything off of that but energy now also has the push mounting up again you can see all of these minions piling up here another big wave crashing into the bot side turret. Top side is Udyr being Udyr. As you might expect, tough to lane against him. Very, very strong. Been kind of the premier go-to pick. There's not really great answers into so far nice wombo combo back in the mid lane here Jojo tries to get away, but palafox is ready to knock him down blabber seeing him. Maybe there's an angle Try to get one back on the Palafox, throws out the W, doesn't find a ton, just a little under contract. But the burst power of Sejuani, not usually that scary! Blaber's coming in, but Palafox barely gets it. gets away, Contractz and Palafox really seeing how far they can push this when Blaber ends up forcing the flash of the energy mid lane. He's not done yet either. He wants to steal away the chickens. Contractz knows he's there, but he's only got 200 HP as the Vi, man. He can't go contest. Yeah, Blaber's a pretty beefy pig here. He got both of the early kills. Who he wants to get? Something back though going for the abyssal dive but blabber can just jump out of the way Arctic assault clears the distance So nothing more to punish or catch here for energy. Yeah, but blabber getting two of the early kills off the tower dive to the early bomby cinder. Means that he's able to bully in, get a little bit of counter jungle back since Contractz had stolen away his Krugs. Preemptively before that fight even turned out maybe this means they just use this priority to start up the dragon Blabber's gonna leash it out right now while Vulcan and Berserker push up on this bottom wave, and they have Jojo pushing in mid lane too, so. It's very important for NRG to start stacking the grubs as early as they can in this game because they have the Udyr top. Should use that to their advantage so you're just rather see grub prio over early drakes anything like that for energy well for energy side Yeah, I think so get that split pushing going A little bit more value, a little bit easier. At least be wary if energy is trying to do those cross map trades palafox level 6 here on the taliyah I always want to see first taliyah ultimates result in some kind of a big movement here It's similar to something like a nocturne Where it's long cooldown, but you have so much presence from somewhere else I want to see him affect the other lanes with it Jojo with the push right now And how the fuck still looking since Jojo had to use it Flash the last time they got the kill on him too as soon as contracts gets to level 6 I think it's gonna be a repeat contracts gank in mid lane. Okay. No flash on the Azir ultimate into do. Seismic shove, look for the kill combo again. Contracts, if he's able to get the grubs, those things do give a lot of experience. Yeah, Blaber having the edge with that level six is a big difference maker But he's just happy to start off with the chicken camp right now contract secures the first grub Moving on to number two. These are not going down exceptionally quickly. Yeah, but we do has got so much prio on topside Constantly pushing here is able to make sure Blabber will secure the grubs for energy so on Turtles checklist for energy, okay? They've corrected the game from the early dive Should be able to get all three. Oh, they cease to join in here. Yep. Oh, they're going to go all out. Fudge is going to bring Dopple into a 2v1 before Contractz can even make it over. I feel like, man, you can never, ever forget about where Kassante is in respect to the terrain, or you're gonna end up in a spot like that. Beautiful stuff they're able to bring him back into his own pocket next to his jungler, but here's the repeat gank Towards mid lane so just slides into tower no problem for him Yeah, he's not worried about that when you even even with the thumbs up. That's the yeah the ganks not gonna do anything, okay? See you later. I'll blow the equal down c9 is in a pretty prime position now What do you? want to see him do from here. They just need to maintain and make sure Azir can push waves safely while he has no flash right now. All right so they had a poll in chat who's gonna Bounce back from super week because both these teams had a little bit of a rough super week cloud9 obviously More of a rough one, but chat sided very slim margin for energy. Okay. If you're looking at it right now, Turtle, which side are you on? Game's still pretty close. I'm still on energy side. I feel like they still have the. The strong by Taliyah combo. I just want to see it happen Well blabber right now. Just making sure that he maintains presence in the jungle trying to put down a couple of control wards Just trying to keep an eye on where this enemy jungler is gonna be, stop contracts from finding those ganks, finding that point-and-click Guaranteed engages. Dokla goes to proxy. Yep, Udyr doing Udyr things He's got two turret plates already on the top side of the map You mentioned the grubs the extra pushing power their extra gold value help out with the splitting later on to, but Vulcan's now out onto the map, not quite level 6 here yet for the Bard, very very close to get his ultimate for some playmaking. doesn't count he's immediately got a retreat as energy sends in more men now Jojo retreating back underneath the turret seismic shove just barely not gonna find him there could have been in some serious danger If it did but Jojo staying safe enough for now the flash just about ready to go again I believe does have the ulti ready to cast to as Vulcan is trying to again rotate around be able to be there stop any kind of play they're making but do it carefully enough that he doesn't get caught himself in the process. Contracts on top of a control ward just waiting to see if C9 tries to... force something, you can turn it around. Yeah, everybody in the game knows they got eyeballs for JoJo. Flash is back up now for the Azir though, so it makes it even scarier. Context is in trouble. Contracts getting caught there try to use the ball breaker now turns it right back around on to Jojo's Azir But the flash out of the way of the seismic shove means contracts is done As Vulcan goops the timing, yeah that part wasn't great, but the part before it was good for C9. Yeah, we had timing misses on both sides. Palafox was not ready to follow up on the Contractz ultimate, so he didn't get the Seismic Shove out of it either. So there was no counter kill for NRG. Another big one here for Cloud9. All right, I was very well played by c9. They just had everyone around mid because they knew that That the action was going to be there Now energy. I'll try to at least get something back here on the bottom Bottom side, grab the turret plates, both TPs used to bring the mid laners back into their lane after the scuffle. A single kill on both of them, only a couple of difference in CS. But one of the biggest differences right now, the Nashor's Tooth, first full item spike completed for JoJo, because Palafox stopped to grab the Sorcerer's Shoes instead of fully investing into the one completed item, so JoJo feeling pretty strong right now but again without that flash without an ulti he's got to be careful cuz Vi could always be around. Energy bringing up extra players as Vulcan goes on a magical journey trying to get away where is energy gonna go? Who do they decide to chase Vulcan's your target for now? Abyssal dive coming in to throw him up energy knocks him down Palafox gets paid and contract starts up the drain Honestly, it looked a little bit like NRG were also having the same debate that you were having while you're casting that flower He's like, which one are they gonna go? Well, Palafox flashed towards towards JoJo, but then they end up getting the kill onto Vulcan anyways, so they do get the dragon. They don't get the chase down onto JoJo, but Doakless right back. out onto the map and we see Blabberz currently on the minimap on the grubs trying to make sure that NRG at the very least will not get 6 and he wants to make sure that They don't get five for the extra void mites. He doesn't have smite though. He used his smite on the first one I believe yeah, this could be a problem. Okay, I'm gonna get five there. Yeah, it's four grubs. They're gonna try Try to guarantee that Blabber can't steal away the last one, a TP's coming in. Energy might just have to abandon it here, JoJo gets stopped by the Unraveled Earth. Contracts for the rest of Energy. cannot secure the fifth grub. C9 critically preventing the break point, preventing the Voidmites from spawning as Energy does not want to take the fight any further. Definitely like this play too, right afterwards, they just teleport Dokkaebi down to the bottom side. But Cloud9, like you said, they stopped the critical 5 grub points for that really... annoying Udyr split push, slow it down a tiny bit. Looks like Dokkaebi is actually not gonna go for the turret plate on the bottom side. He just teleported down there just to clear out one wave. And get his reset off to backside here for fudge Honestly this as a later the game goes it's gonna be really interesting watching can Jojo actually actually work through this kind of beefy frontline or is the Vi plus Taliyah plus Senna ultimate over the top combo gonna be enough to assassinate him basically through all of this peel that they have. I think it would be much easier for C9 to play if they actually first engage with the Sejuani and the Bard, just so they can navigate the fight easily. But I think if it bites me it goes first. It's gonna be pretty hard for Jojo Yeah, definitely very scary especially the extra damage of a Senate ultimate coming over the top. Yeah that hundred percent to zero always looks scary when he's got a flash. And Blabber's definitely super tanky right now on the Sejuani, really beefed up. So him leading the charge, maybe. if Vulcan is able to get one of those big Bard ultimates to make it easy to land the follow up. We try to challenge blabber they're gonna steal away the gromp, but at what cost who he popping the thick skin Trying to get away in time as Jojo's entrance is gonna be blocked off by pallet box, but blabber has already killed support who he's down and FBI is about to get knocked out but Zerker takes the kill and C9's up 7 to 3. own worst enemies. The biggest Cloud9 plays feels like defending on the tower dive on bottom and then defending jungle. Again here, another big one for Cloud9. Honestly, energy just needs to calm it down a little bit around this bottom lane. Talk to me a little bit about this situation as somebody who's played in a in a professional game like this, you try to make a couple of plays, they end up backfiring. How do you sort of like reset and get yourself back in a mind state to stop those sort of mistakes from continuing? I think they just have to take a deep breath and recognize their win condition They really need to get Taliyah and Vi involved in these plays, and I don't think they are right now Contracts well Vi's getting involved to play, but is it the play he wants? JoJo's getting locked down here with a start, beautifully done. Contractz, Palafox, and FBI have already found the enemy mid laner, but can they get any more? Flabber with the flashback away. Trying to get underneath the tier one turret as Palafox tries to cut him off here with the Weaver's wall FBI needs a couple more shots, but who he's tonguing gonna find the mark shut down back over to Senna Still, as Berserker fully retreats and Vulcan is left to the graveyard. Contracts at FBI, both coming right back around. Piercing Darkness finds him and Palafox goes on a rampage. Energy get three action-packed I love watching energy play cuz even after they fail on the first invade bottom side Then they get right back to it, another fight, another victory, and they're able to swing the gold lead right back in their favor. Cloud9 with the teleport top for JoJo. It means that they should be able to at least get a tower in the aftermath though. This one feels like a yo-yo. We're just throwing that thing out and back and out and back. This game's pretty wild with 13 kills in 16 minutes. Still under 1,000 gold separating the two teams. You can see on this graph here the greatest distance that it was was 1674 in the favor of c9 before that three-man play that happened at the hands of energy In the bottom lane, we do have the Herald alive on the map. It's going to be there for another three minutes or so still, and I don't think we're going to just see it expire this game. Cloud9 putting a lot of players in the topside river. Alright, I don't think it's going to stop anytime soon, Flowers, because we've got a dragon coming up, and NRG grabbing the Scuttlecrab vision first. They've got plenty of wards here looking out for the cloud 9 members coming to try and check to Nice job there popping the blast cone got the ghost too. Yeah, but just to walk away from that one. Remember that Fudge is entirely MR right now. First item is just a Kaynek Rooker. Yes, he has Tabis, but that's not worth a ton on its own. As Blabber and the rest of C9, they see at least... Two players from the enemy team in the bottom river, they're going to use the opportunities to secure this Herald for themselves. While NRG's got three guys working on the Drake, they should be able to grab that. So a cross map trade in the objective. C9 is going to look to try to grab some value here from the eye of the herald. Honestly, them opting for Rift Herald and trying to get through that some of this outer tower gold here for either the Azir or the Varus and just buffing up these DPS champs. The two carry comp from Cloud9 with both of them being auto attack based here. I feel like this is definitely setting themselves up for the path to victory for Cloud9. They just have to be able to execute on this team. fight and actually keep those two carries alive. When JoJo and Berserker have flash, it's definitely playable for Cloud9. When they do not have flash, the energy dive is so. scary though that that combo with Vi guaranteeing the setup for Palafox one of those two carries is definitely going to get annihilated I think for Vulcan he just has to look out for his ulti onto the Taliyah, when by ulti's his Azir. So you block the Taliyah, stop the follow up. Stop the combo. And then Azir's ready to fire. Everybody else works together and kills Vi once she dives in. C9 staying together, staying grouped up. They have to have recognized how energy is... Trending towards mistakes in this game, if you're grouped up, if you can punish those, energy can just gift you the game. But energy with four kills on Palafox, all my eyes are on this Taliyah. to see if he can get the carry done, to see if he can step up and continue making the types of plays that can deliver them the dub here against Cloud9, get revenge for that first game of the split. month energy with control over the mid lane gonna push things up here FBI continuing to harvest those souls the Senate up to 76 18 and a half minutes into the game as energy control as the bottom side river. to ult ready for PalFox to cut people off, but Cloud9 doing their duty here, grouping up again in mid lane, using that Rift Herald, trying to get this outer tower money. looking for there we go okay summoned up going for it turrets already down but now where's the fight gonna go contracts here with a very front he's gonna be gobbled up by who he just stay alive wanted an angle. He wanted a pincer attack, but the Sundiss summoned up to make sure that C9 had a banner to rally around. Dokla doesn't have an entrance into the fight. Energy still trying to just... Regain control over the mid lane on their side of the map. The SunDisk slowly bleeding out. FBI and Palafox trying to keep Fudge away as he steps forward to establish some vision. Control ward. In the brush next to the Raptors, but the chickens are being led on a long journey away from their home Okay, they're finally gonna reset and the vision gets cleared. Yeah, both blabber and fudge are really good for face checking right now, trying to get into enemy jungle, push their territory forward. But that's basically the expected value of the objective trade that they saw earlier. You know, when you go for that Rift Herald, you're expecting that's going to be your mid turret. Basically, guaranteed with that one, Cloud9 do a good job defending their carries, staying strong here. the five-person setup. C9's in a really solid position right now for this game. I think they're just waiting on Berserker's second item, and they should be good to start Baron as well. Blade of the Ruined King already done for him, as long as he's protected well enough to get those auto attacks off, this guy's gonna hurt a lot. But I'm curious if- Again, maybe if you can't find JoJo with that Vi-Taliyah combo, you just turn it into Berserker, blow him up instead. Vulcan's really gonna need to be paying attention here with this Bard, like you already talked about Turtle. As soon as you see Vi going in, you gotta stop the follow-up. for the Lich Bane second here, because he's got the early Sheen. Nice little price reduction on the component item this patch as well. 100 gold off of Sheen. Really. really just an efficient component now with the ability haste and the proc that's going to give you. But it does mean he's not going to have the Liandry's for the teamfight, so isn't going to have the Liandry's. injuries for the Tahm Kench, the Vi, or the Udyr, but he does have really good burst damage, especially with that auto-attack coming out so quickly now with the new Lich Bane. I do believe the Lich Bane had the base AD ratio nerfed on it a little bit with this patch too. Just knocked down ever so slightly. Yup, from 100 down to 75 for a lot of mage champions. It's not super impactful just because most of its coming from your AP ratio anyway But still something to be cognizant of as the gold is tied dead even between these two teams The Drake is spawning in a little bit over 30 seconds, and they made the call for power box to push out top side first Energy again trying to play the map here look at the mini-map. They've got bot and top both pushing for themselves. Dragon coming up shortly here, so they've got their side waves correct. They also have the teleport and the ulti ready. for Palafox. Maybe they can get that top tower before dragon spawns, but Cloud9 stay strong. You mentioned it multiple times, but sticking as five with those defensive ultis ready, trying to stand strong and keep Berserker and JoJo safe. Well, it seems like energy feels weaker right now, so they're just gonna give the strength and they don't even wanna fight it. Exactly, they're just gonna surrender at C9. We'll grab their second Drake of the game. You can see the crypt bloom completed here for Palafox He went ahead got the verdant barrier second, which I really liked I think The value of the spell shield is pretty high against the composition drafted by C9, but then recognizing, hey, they have two massive meatballs, one of which just rushed Kaynek Rooker. He needs to be able to penetrate through that magic resistance as Doakla is going to see if there's an angle here on JoJo. picks on the side lanes now let's see it energy's coming in Jojo trying to get away contracts looking for the chance to go in flashes into the ulti over the top comes Senna but Jojo gets out Seismic shoving gonna find him and energy could not get the combo executed correctly C9 gets their mid laner away small little windows there In between the timing, Kha'Zix is probably going to get there. Yeah, they're just going to start it up. C9 going for this, recognizing, hey, that was a lot of resources. That's Senna ult, that's Taliyah ult. That's Vi ult, that's a lot from the tank of energy and C9 is burning the Baron down They've already got it below 6k, below 5k, down to 4k. Dope is coming in trying to stop them but C9 C9 wants to burn it, Blaber secures the Baron as Fudge tries to dive into the middle of everybody and Gontrax is controlled, JoJo's barely getting away, a Missile Dive onto 4, Fudge is stuck back there. the band is jokes but tries to tear him up and FBI's grabbing a shutdown energy need to find more blabber with a flash out trying to get himself back to the base while still wearing the purple He throws out the W, but he gets slowed down by the tongue. FBI still trying to pursue him, still trying to get all the way there, but Blaber escapes underneath the turret. It is Baron over to C9. at the cost of a two-for-one trade. Oh, no! Into a pause. Such a good call here from Cloud9, though. As soon as there's no vi- ultimate and even though Jojo traded his flash for Contractz flash they know they have so much baron burning power with Azir plus the two item Varus with The buffed up by the way rage blade now on Varus melting right through that Baron So they did get it just in time Even though energy get there and get a two-for-one trade just get plus one in kills, Cloud9 will be very happy because they also kept three baron buffs to push afterwards with. turning into quite the banger compared to, like I said, the first time these two teams played this split, it didn't feel particularly close. It didn't feel like it was, could have gone either way. But this one is. 24 minutes in two Drake's each neither side having enough grubs to spawn the void mites kills are tied gold right next to each other it's could still go Either way so easy it definitely could I got an update the pauses for berserker He had some issue with his keyboard another Peripheral pause flowers, I'm not too happy not too happy keyboard issues Maybe we need to need to inspect them ourselves. What's wrong? Turtles has never paused for a keyboard issue. I don't think I have I yeah, look at this guy You're one of the longest-standing players. We got a pagoda going on. Can we get some of those up here? Yeah, maybe that's the trick. Oh, man. All right, well, hopefully we'll be able to get back in here soon. Whatever's wrong. Yeah, they just really burned that Nash They had the zero and then the various with the two-core Honestly from from the energy side Now it does feel like it's starting to get a bit difficult because cloud 9 keep defending the these attempts at Jojo's life Berserker doesn't have go He does have flash. Maybe they go for the kill onto the onto the varus. Okay, we're gonna get a replay of the last fight Okay, okay Yay! All right, so they're burning down. Really good DPS. Contractz is pretty far, so there's no hope of a steal, but Contractz, look at him charging his Vike. And he goes straight for the play again on to Jojo Palafox set him up. It was a beautiful Taliyah combo actually into fire IQ so as pal Fox doing the work getting Jojo into range and that's like the only reason that they even got the two kills Yeah Who he just landed a four-man? Yeah, the abyssal dive onto four there was crazy because if he doesn't go over the wall I'm pretty sure that contracts can't hit Jojo again and Jojo just walks away with 150 HP still remaining So really nicely done to save that here. You're kind of seeing it going down live the over-the-shoulder cam from Jojo Yeah, now we're looking at a case where it does start to get really difficult for energy here considering how much gold CloudNine has. have gotten on their Azir, on their Varus. PowaFox, though, is still really fed Taliyah. And he does have nine stacks Dark Seal. You mentioned that he just finished his Crypt Bloom. And he should be able to finish, you know, a Banshee's Veil next or something. Unless he just wants to sit on the Vernet Barrier, since they did buff that component as well. But... Maybe it's an upgrade to Mejai's angle and really go for it. I mean, if you fully stack your Darksteel and it's 10 stacks, the value of upgrading into Mejai's is $1,000. Medjai's is so big but then I mean if you upgrade it and then you immediately don't die don't die there's all ten pages value go? Where'd your value go? Okay, I can respect it though. If you feel like, okay, the game's starting to slip away, we gotta make big plays, I'm the only one who can do it, sure, maybe. Then again, you're gonna get flamed if you die, if you lose the pages. Let's see, we don't have any additional updates right now. is the same way that you are, Kobe, is he going to just go ahead and complete the Banshee's Veil or also do you just hit something, you know, Mejai's, Deathcap, whatever, just something turbo damage focused. to try to guarantee that you get that instant burst because the biggest issue for me throughout this game for energy has just been the coordination hasn't felt right. Whether it was the early dive where, okay. Contractz is going back in, but it looks like we probably should have all just walked away or all committed when they tried to make the pick on JoJo in the jungle, but he just barely gets out. Even back in mid lane when there's that slight delay on the fight. follow up with a Contracts LT, there's just a little bit that's not quite there for energy this game. All right, got an update. We're rushing a new keyboard over now. Okay, emergency substitute keyboard. David has the keyboard. Chat, send your energy to David. Running it over as quickly as possible now. Yay! Yeah! We're back into the game! That was really fast. They must have sent a lot of energy. Yeah. That was a bunch. Okay. We're back into the game now. 24 minutes in. Slight gold lead for energy, but you would expect Expect that to swing back into the favor of C9, since like you pointed out, Kobe, they still have the Baron on multiple players. Okay, gotta refocus after the pause. That was the biggest thing. Even Blaber himself was talking about last time when Cloud9 had the big pause. He lost focus. We'll see if uh, honestly, it's not too bad if it said Duani this fed it actually loses focus, he's so tanky and he's got the regeneration from his Warmogs, so Cloud9 have the ability with Baron buff to push up multiple lanes and they have really. good face checkers here in blabber and fudge they're going to push out mid and then rotate basically everybody over yeah having the bard makes it so much nicer for your side a lot a lot more options here with those tunnels general observation about the map state to hold on TP is coming in Energy having to disengage now as Blaber misses the Senjuani ulti, Chains of Corruption also missed. C9 saw what looked like maybe an angle, but they cannot Execute successfully so energy just walks off from that one worth pointing out C9's got this baron buff for a little bit over another minute once it expires. It'll be about 60 seconds from then until the drakes so c9 does have the opportunity to set up the rift for an advantageous position Remember with both teams already at two drakes apiece the next one to be sole point for someone who he jumps in the abyssal dive but nobody else is close enough to do a lot especially not with fudge being the only one here on the front line even though cloud 9 you know, miss the Sejuani ults from good evasion maneuvers from Hui, and then he flashes the bear assault. Five Nines still get an isolated outer turret for JoJo for this. that is working on Deathcap, which scales so well considering you added the Lich Bane with another AP ratio onto him. So, JoJo approaching three. core for Jojo and for Berserker. Energy, they've gotta start feeling the pressure here. They might start feeling a little desperate. We might see another one of these super. deep aggro plays from them. Contractz has flash, Palafox has flash. They really need to make good on one of those picks and try and get someone from Cloud9 isolated. Get some of those key summoner spells off of the Cloud 9 carries. Because if those two are just safe, the Azir and the Varus right now will demolish you. Well baron has faded gentlemen. It is 60 seconds until the drake spawns We don't really see a whole lot happening in that bot side river right now. There is currently energy vision Controlling it, but a couple of Cloud9 wards on the back side of the pit to also see if NRG is trying to make more of an entry into that part of the rift right now. Now, as C9 is more focused on the top side, they've got all five players either in mid or in that top side river area as JoJo is set up to push top lane. content with farming right now on the Azir yeah look at this how nice is it to have two people shadowing blabber and Vulcan the two babysitters to come Watch JoJo farm on the side lanes, they're like please, just eat up a little bit more money here. I'm surprised they didn't want to, oh, he's going, he's going for Zhonya's instead of the Deathcap. here. It's pretty smart versus Levi, I think. Yeah. It's their only win condition. He got the Seeker, so he has an active already for a stopwatch to deny that Cloud9 play. Really smart or deny that energy play cloud9 really looks like a fight might break out here Yeah, we got energy on the approach a TP coming into the mid lane From Palafox, who he's gonna be caught by the Bard ulti, but he's the only target. Now he's gonna try to tank it up. Senna ults over the top, who he's still at about half HP. Fudge coming in, looking to complete the dive as Berserker goes on a rampage. He's thrown back into the team, all out goes Fudge, all in goes Contractz, but he's 1v5, he ain't alive! Everybody died in C9, 3 for nothing. There ya go. to go right into their hands. They have scaled. Cloud 9 protect. And they collect. Dragon number three. That was good, I like that, that was smooth, that was slick. Yeah, I'm pretty sure once the Varus also gets a stopwatch, this game should be over. Yeah, really good, immediately, immediately used. Seekers armed guard right after purchasing, but honestly they already had the advantage in a team fight here You know where they're getting so much free damage on how function is just too far you to be to the midside but he just wasn't close enough for this fight. Yeah, so they get a really big head start in the health bars here. Lots of free damage onto that energy front line. Yeah, it was all off. It's looking really hard for energy. No Cloud 9 currently in the process of bouncing back from their super week I mean, hey, I was saying I wanted to see Berserker and Vulcan also not have the same the same kind of mistakes that they had last week. Berserker is currently 4-0-4 on the Varus. Blabber, and all the losses that C9 had for Superwick, a lot of people were complaining that he didn't have the same level of presence and pressure. pressure that you would normally expect from him. 3-1 and 7 here on the Sejuani, only one kill that he hasn't been a part of here for this team. Let's see if this engage works out in mid lane as who he turned into a golden seed. Statue once again, they're gonna put the first into the Tom Kench and Jojo sits him down C9 have picked up one and the Baron is alive on the Rift now Energy are once again tasked with trying to stop it. They now know how fast C9 is at taking this. Blade of the Ruined King Varus plus the Azir, this is so difficult for Energy to stop. but they're making the approach. C9 already have it down to below half HP down to about 1 third now. Doakland contracts they just know they can't approach all this is going to be is a team... fight loss on top of a Baron if they go in for it. C9 still chasing seeing if maybe they can pick one up at the back end of things. Set up for the disengage Fudge goes over the wall Q3 won't hit anybody Magical Journey don't matter, Pathmaker gets him out, alright, no kills on the back but C9 is happy to turn a pick into a bear and nevermind, we ain't done yet, Contractz gonna be caught here with a... Senna ulti, trying to reinforce him, keep him protected, but Pudge does a lot of damage. Contractz still alive, as JoJo gets away into the back. Palafox wants to chase, and JoJo's on the run! goes in, but JoJo shuffles it right back. PowerFox denied! Energy died! And C9 is loving the way it is mid-game! I don't was trying to get away, but no sir punch knocks him down I'm berserker is ending the game the whole time berserker is just over here annihilating towers. That's the ADC dream right there he's inside the base or the rest of cloud nine and they're going for it cloud nine had a rough week last time around but They're ready to stop that here. Who he is not going to stop anything on his own. The C9 lost streak will grind to a halt as they. Speed Energy, again, 16-8. JoJo gave a... That game really just cracked open. Yeah. Yeah.  They were able to play it safe here. I was really, yeah, the coordination from NRG was just off, I feel like, this game. NRG, Kobe, you said it best, back at the start, NRG was just... just giving them stuff. Cloud9 playing well, but playing reactively, not having that pressure on them to have to make things happen, because the energy's just like, all right, we're YOLOing it. Go, go, go. PVP, and it didn't work out for them. Energy's going to have to really work on the coordination if they want to play that crazy, play that out of pocket. But for C9, you got it. to be breathing a little bit of a sigh of relief you get rid of all of that losing streak that bad mental and you're finally back feeling like okay we can execute a little bit yeah they went with with a safe style here to get that safe first win, and they're gonna go crazy tomorrow. I mean, hey man, it worked out. You guys were talking about having the front line, having the two damage. The two threat damage comp and it worked out the Taliyah the vibe both getting shut down By the time you have that Sonya's hourglass ready to go on the Azir good stuff Coming out from C9 and a reminder to all y'all fantasy LCS is happening on sleeper It's not too late to sign up and start a league with your friends and crush their dreams with your own LCS super team super team We've seen them go good. We've seen them go bad. How about yours? We're gonna see. You can head on over to sleeper.com or sleeper.app to give it a try right now. That is our first game of the day. All wrapped up and so it's time to join Emily and Jojo on stage for an interview Hello, I'm here with the victorious Jojo piano after C9 kind of stopped their losing streak so first of all congratulations thank you I mean it feels kind of weird winning I'm not used to this right now but it's a good feeling I know in an interview just this past week, you actually talked to Ashley Kong about how losing makes things more interesting. Do you have any comments on that after your first win in the I mean, I think a lot of people including me were expecting like c9 to kind of just shit on everyone this whole split But I think now that I think about it if we realize our mistakes takes right now and we improve I think that's much better so I don't think the losses were too bad on how we reflected on it so yeah and going into this week what was your Preparation like like in draft. Yeah, I mean we tried playing a bunch of new champions because I think Our champs were kind of obvious of what we're gonna So I think we're trying to expand our temple a lot more. So yeah When you look at draft just because it's something that a lot of the community has pointed out. I have also pointed out I've been critical at times. When you're looking at drafting for this team, I think one thing that people are curious about is balancing the strength of you all as individuals. individual players, which is quite high, with the actual coordination of composition. So how much thought goes into that? I mean, definitely a lot of thought goes into that because every single player on this team. carry right so I mean I feel like that's really good we can make draft really versatile so that's what we're trying to do right now since every player can carry so yeah. Nice I will still defend the Vayne mid actually. I mean, I thought being mid was good if I had more practice. I definitely could have carried but Nice, we'll look forward to it again in the future. Maybe I'm going forward looking out at of how the C9 team is doing, obviously you get the win today, how are you guys going to build on this win towards the future? confidence boost that we won today. I think if we lost today it definitely wouldn't have been good so I think we're getting our confidence back so yeah. Alright well all the best. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me. And we'll see you guys back on the other side of the break. Thank you.  Thanks for watching! I'm Rayo from Immortals Progressive.

You know, winning LCS, top of my bucket list. I was one game away. It was tactical. 2021, we were awesome. 2-3. It was very disappointing. We were also up 2-1. Dude. Why'd you put your new rig in the basement? Didn't you hear? Bill's a good gillionaire now. Basically, my new connection is so strong I can game anywhere. Check it out.

Thanks for watching! you Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching!  Thank you for watching! Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! Thank you for watching! Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! Altyazı M.K. Thanks for watching!  You to those attending today from the Legends of Runeterra Invitational. I think I saw their sign earlier. I don't approve, but whatever. Welcome. Legends are a terror greater than League of Legends. That's a different sign. Someone said LOR greater than LOL. Either way, we're into Immortals versus Dignitas. I think Immortals, surprising three and four. I keep asking if they're good. I re-watched some of their games, I think they are definitely good actually. So, curious to see if they can keep up the momentum against the New Testament. Yeah, I'm curious to see if... Ole keeps picking the highest win rate supports. True. Elise was on there, he did not pick it. That's not gonna happen. I'm still kind of sad about that, you know? He's not lying. The hen's special. As we see Kalista, Ori getting banned out by DIG, and then the Vi and Senna getting banned out by INT. out there right now, as you can see in the wind rays out there. Heimer is very doable. That seems like a sample size problem for 60% on Heimer. We're going to see the Heimer. Oh my goodness, I think Maokai Bard. Oh, it says Masters Plus, yes, that's always going to be an issue. Minimum 100 games, it's like, oh yeah, he's 61 and 40. Yeah. do if your support just turns to you and they're like I'm picking based on win rate and that's something really weird. I'd be extremely open to all of them actually. I do believe the stats though. I actually love that one of the signs said pick Illaoi you cowards as we're in a rich game. So this guy picked Illaoi before the bus came through. Nice.  I would be extremely excited to see a lot of it. On the side of Dignitas, I know we've been talking about them a fair bit being like an exciting 2-in-5 or like it's... It's nice when the last place team is this exciting and we have some goal graphs from their previous games and I think it does speak to how many games they've actually had leads in. You can see three of those eventual losses, one to Hunter Thieves, one to Team Liquid, and one to FlyQuest. They had goal leads in the game after the 20-minute mark, so they're actually a fairly. solid early game team, but they've just been unable to actually kill the Nexus. Yeah, one thing I really appreciate as we see the Smolder hover, is it gonna go through for Dig? We actually did highlight DIG as one of those teams that might be willing to throw out some picks to try to move themselves up in the standings. We have our first smolder lock-in! And we actually... will not know where it's going until later because like I said NACL was on this patch yesterday and we saw this champion in both the mid and the bot lane. Yeah, and I will say Tomo is the biggest smolder appreciator. True! Even when he was not available in the last week's games, he was still playing the pick, so I feel like... he's the most studied up on the champion so even if it is a decent flex pick I fully expect it to go over to Tomo. Rich, Quinn, Smulder, what's the difference? I don't know if they need carries, right? Rich's eyes are wide open. let's go all right so for imt we have the zary lock-in we also i do want to call out the um ivern for our mayo that's one of his uh, stronger champions, we've seen him have success on that, uh, against C9. And also, Tactical with, uh, Zeri, even though he's on a 3-14, leads the LCS in kills, you can see Tome 4th place in kills as well, so this is one of the reasons I think the bottom of the standing seems so exciting is these teams that haven't necessarily won all the games are actually leading the league in kills, which is so cool. Super not normal. Yeah, and I think it made sense to everybody going in from the offseason, because at least for IMT's sake, they had a clear identity that they wanted to play through mid and wanted to play through mid. play through bot lane, and it makes sense. Olleh is a trigger-happy support. If he gets a hand on Thresh, Nautilus, or anything like that, he's going to be calling for help on the bot side of the map, but we know how. lane focused tactical is of the player so it makes a lot of sense and I feel like their wins have come off the back of it. This is a really exciting game so far actually. Love the fact that we're seeing the buffed up Zeri. It has hypercarrier potential because of our Mayo's Ivern. And we have this smolder mystery. Not only is it going to be the first smolder in the LCS. we still don't know where it's going to go you can't okay smoldering atrox would be track i think smolder what into atrox would be garbage yeah i don't have to I'm pretty sure it's going to be bottom. It's Choma. What is the, so talk to us a little bit about the Zeri-Smolder matchup. So the Zeri-Smolder matchup... I think it's favored to Zeri, like, past level 6, I think, like, pre-6, like, Smolder just has full advantage. Smolder can just keep pushing the wave. poking Zarya down, but I think at level six, Zarya can just look for all in timers. And a question that I have is like, what support do you usually want to pair up with a smolder in general? That's actually a tricky question. I've seen teams play enchanters and hard supports, or hard engaged supports. I feel like the Milio might actually be a good pairing with the Smolder to increase the range. That makes sense to me. I think he's going to have a tough time dealing with Ivern just in general, having to... dip in and out of his bushes so that's a question that I would have but you could just get like a hard engaged support too I guess like the Rakan and just set up the ulti you know Yeah, if they lock this in, Rell would flex to jungle. And we'd know they're lane. That also gives Olleh the counterpick potential, but yeah, Olleh's just going to jungle. He can't because Dig banned it out. Oh, they banned it, right. Yeah, Dig got rid of both the Nautilus and I assume the, well. Well, not I assume, we know the Maokai ban is going up against Olle and not Armao, who's already locked in the Ivern. Quay support, or mid? Hey, Quay support is not- I'm not the win rate king, let me tell you. So we'll see. Hey, I saw Beryl do really well in one series. I don't know what Ole would pick here. Knowing Ole though. you might just pick like Bard or something. Hue locked in. I mean, it could be only on Hue support, but we'll obviously know with this last pick. Yeah. I think any form of engage here would be. nice. Leona was something that was coming up to mind because you're going up against the Rakan, so pretty clear-cut way of engaging into Dignitas with comp. I just feel like Leona is not a very good champion. champion right now. Why's that? We'll see, though. I just feel like she dies very easily. When she goes in, she's just committed. It's kind of easy to just beat up. a lot of engage on the side of dig and see what they end up blocking here this is yeah this is super interesting I would hold to say this is still a flex but it's not it's actually could be Yone toppling into the Aatrox if they want to end up going so this is a really dynamic comp from Actually, this is really exciting. Rell's gonna probably be their, I guess they have her con, but sole form of engage. So, I'm really loving the con. that we have here. And, Jatt, I want you to ask the question one more time. Uh, what's the question, Raz? Is IMT good? Are they? Because even though we're talking about the draft and that has been the focus for me it's been the play it's something different about IMT that we've been seeing in their recent games and especially in their wins and for me mistakes like these that we see from Mavs mask, where he ends up making a misplay when they go up against Cloud9, usually costs them the game. Because, you know, you make one mistake, barons are going to be an issue, and in this play... Actually, IMT not only recognized they're going to be a man down, they're sticking around just so they can dissuade from a C9 going for Baron here, but they realized one thing, and one thing clearly. C9 is dissipating, Udyr is going towards the mid lane wave. So they're actually separated. So, Bard just sends the ulti, they find a 4v5 play, being able to pick. off Jojo Pyeon and they end up winning a fight and IMTs in the past usually play extremely scared. Don't look for plays like that. But this is a different IMT to me where they make... a mistake initially, stick around a little bit for Barron, and they capitalize on a misplay coming in from C9, and I think they can do the same versus Dignitas. Once again, let's head over to the cast, let's get us in the game. for two simultaneous debuts. Not only the first Smolder played in the LCS as he just now became playable this weekend. In any major region, dude. Yup. First, Hui in the LCS as well. They're on opposite sides of the Rift. One starts out with 100% win rate. The other one's got a big, fat donut. Yeah, and Smolder, of course. was picked in challengers but this is the first pick for smolder in any tier one region so I'm very excited for this champ I want to see if we're going to to get the Spear of Sojin start for him because that has really been gaining popularity. You get so much ability haste that that item is the premier source of. of ability haste now that they've started removing it from a lot of other sources. Yeah. And you're able to stack so insanely quickly with it. I'm really interested to see it specifically in. this game because it's up against Zeri. I was talking to Shogo, who's a multi-region challenger player, won CLaw a couple of times, asking him about it because he was posting a lot of screenshots. about, you know, winning with it in challenger, here's how you play it. And he was talking about how it feels like it has a similar role to Azir or a Sivir, where it might not command powerful early lane prio. But if you get on a lane without being behind, you're going to outpace your opponent. You're going to have so much AoE damage, so much scaling potential. And considering he's up against the Pentakill Pikachu that inspired Night... in players for multiple, multiple months. I really want to see how this head-to-head shakes out. And to kill Pikachu with a fresh, shiny buff flower. Yes, sir. up on Zeri ultimate as well here tactical was one of our original Zeri players too if you remember he had a viral clip but Rich is surrounding it. Yeah, he immediately flashes away the root caller. If that would have hit him there, he could have been in some serious trouble. This is such a sick draft from both squads. This game is so fun. They're so so many things to talk about, because Ivern is one of my favorite pairings for any jungle plus AD carry. Obviously, the one on camera now, Kha'Zix. LCS pick has been pretty popular in the LEC honestly, but Smolder here hiding from us Flowers who's that Pokemon? Who was behind that brush? Who could it be? Who could possibly be in there? So I do have to, I'm just going to go ahead. I'm going to come clean about something right now before the minions spawn. Honesty is the best policy, Flowers. I have no idea what this dude's abilities are. Not even the beginning of a comprehension of this. Wait, you're talking about Huey, right? Cause I know you know Smolder. I know Smolder's ability, man. Say him now! Say him! And you're gonna like it. Super scorcher breath, hot shoe, flap, flap, flap. And? Mom. There you go. There. We've got all of them. My favorite part is the. My favorite part is the little wiggle when he screams mom It's so funny to watch that ultimate by the way since it starts behind you. Sometimes for lane phase, you know, people will cast it backwards so you can get the quicker end of it. Yeah. Down on them, but we'll. We'll see, there's so many tips and tricks to go over. Right now, in lane though, Mask being our first LCS way. This is a champion that, I have a lot of confidence in the team fighting of. Sometimes it can get a little dicey towards the early stages, you know, when people are ganking you and say, nevermind. Hold on. I'll get a little spicy down here really low. Yeah, can't get it can get a little dicey early on in some skirmishes and ganking But the champs scale so well because you have just massive AoE We and really strong range so speaking of scaling up I do want to go ahead and just talk Really quickly about a couple of smolder points because I know a lot of people either have a plate up Maybe they don't play any carries didn't bother reading The tooltips, the breakpoints you gotta look at for his stacks, and you get a stack for last hitting with Q or damaging an enemy with any spell. 25 gets you your first AOE. Your farming is really slow. until you hit 25. Then 125 gets you the ones that bounce behind and 225 is your I'm OP now level 16 Kayle type of moment where you're spewing true damage onto everybody with a dot it's very very strong but that's what we're going to keep track of is how fast he can hit that 225 break yeah and you can all keep track at home look at this Nice little nifty passive tracker that they have over smolder in the bottom right there currently at 13 now generally the The aim is to get it by around you know mid-game 20 minutes Yeah, kind of average there have been some crazy ones. I was talking with you know the guys on the dive about but Azalea was like, he got to 225 at like 17 minutes. That's really fast. There are some early ones, of course, you know, if you get. some really nice bounces you can you can throw your snot ball through to hold on Rich is trying to get away from a gank here in the top lane our Mayo shows up Castle should have enough damage to bring him down here. It's first blood over to the Ivern. The burn from red takes him out. Immortals are on the- Is that wrong? It's a tree he don't have snot the snot isn't oh the dragon. Oh, I thought you were saying our mayo Hit him with a snot ball Haven't you played I've heard Oh, the dragon is the one with the snot ball that tries to stack up with it. You gotta stack your snot balls if you want to succeed on smolders. It's called a chute! And the big fiery ball comes out our males on the invade here and did did catch him on those on those Raptors So they got visual confirmation that he's on the top side Nice quick trading there coming out from mask as rich again has to respect has to be careful He's got the ward there in the pixel brush that lets him know that our mayo is hanging around. Yes excerpt it is got all right got a stack we got another stack he only needs two more and then he has the AoE on the queue which like I said is gonna make it much easier to really accelerate the pace of those stacks, you get all the ranged minions low, hit one of them with a Q, it blows up all three. Nothing to it, very fast farming. As he has cleared the threshold now, 26 stacks. Five minutes into the game, he gets the first evolution. All right, smolder scaling nicely on bottom side. Meanwhile, pushing mid lane with Hui, pretty effortless there. Max making good. use of the mana return auto attacks, shoving in Dove, taking out so much of his HP, half of the turret plate himself, and does get his first back. Castle dodging away from the q3 there from rich means that they will not have the CC to lock him down long enough for x you to make an entrance even with crash down castle can just get away from it so X you asked walk it off. of the Krugs, because Rell is one of the best, our grub taker on the Rift, but Immortals, if we're examining their draft, then one of the things that goes under the radar with. all of these new picks is Castle's Aatrox, and if we bring up their previous games here... Never mind, we might have too much action. Just face checking into the brush there. Olleh immediately hitting him with the shield at daybreak, forcing out the cleanse, the flash to follow it. Olleh's getting the money and Tomo's down. Nice. Ole killer instinct here in the brush Leona flashing on him has the ignite Death to the dragon at number one, but there's the castle a truck stats very good for Immortals last week was very good to them and he had a couple of those ones dropped so feels very confident on the champion I know, and Immortals here also have some really good late game options. Not just the lanes, but the Ivern plus the Zeri for later on, Kway really big. AOE damage for a lot of these clumped up melee champions that Dignitas have drafted. That ultimate that's on display for you now is going to be one of those big tools that Mask has to counter. counter these grouped up melee champs as Dignitas, all but the dragon, should provide pretty good damage. Soaks here. for Mass to be able to dump his spells into. And as Mass continues putting points in the abilities as he levels up and really maxing out that subject disaster, the Q for all the. damage can clear out those waves incredibly quickly with that pseudo rumble ulti that he can cast through the molten fissure as Isles and Tomo just absorbing some pressure here as our Mayo makes his appearance And remember last time around when these two teams did play. Dignitas got the win, Mass does get hit. Mass getting hit as the immediate follow up with a flash from Exu. They need a little bit more damage and they'll find it. Dignitas gets their first kill of the game and they get it on Dove. the worst of the outcomes possible for Mass to flash afterwards. He does not flash the chain and once Dove hits the chain beautiful follow-up from xQ flashes in with the rel, full combo, and then with mask also flashing after that and still dying. Very very big possible momentum here. for Dignitas. Asylus getting early kills is always so, so nice. Ole not afraid to just immediately jump in and fight against the Rakan. Leona being one of those picks. Whenever the meta is Xayah Rakan defined in the bottom lane Leona will eventually show up if enough time passes without nerfs because of how excellent she can play into Rakan as as a champion. But Maskey, the way, I mean, he's got range, he's got power, he's got CC, but he has no mobility whatsoever. He's got style, he's got grace. They can throw a puddle on the ground and walk a little faster through it. Now topside, it's Castle under pressure and he's not going to get very far, Exu takes him down. Dignitas ties the game. Exu, the highlight here for Dignitas. Dignitas the first one was set up for him really easily in mid lane by dub hitting a nice chain But there goes back topside gets another gank off takes down castle It's gonna be a dragon in compensation here for Immortals since the enemy jungler shows topside But that is some nice money into rich on a a rich style top lane takeover champion. Yone, truly the possibilities of the 1v9. Trying to get that combo, the dream scenario into the back line where he could annihilate the Zarya and the Hui, those really strong late game carries. So we'll see what Rich can do, because in the last year with Dignitas. Most of the stories that we were telling were about rich champions And yeah stuff he was picking in the topside and his counter picks for top lane and the possibilities of running over the game there so XU doing a good job setting up both his solo lanes so far. Mask could be in trouble. XU staying right on the very edge of vision. Mask still stepping back up, Exu's just going to try to steal away this chicken camp. You can see that it's primed with the grove from the Ivern. Uh-huh, that always feels so good. Oh yeah, I just feel like... You wanted to come pick these up, huh? No, you put some work into this you spent some health and some mana to channel on this damn shame Yoink all cast Q and they're mine. Well Dignitas still trying to get enough stacks here on tomo. That's exactly what I was talking about right there You get either all three may laser all three range low and then execute them with one super scorch your breath together He's up to six 65 stacks. Remember again, the next breakpoint, 125, is going to get the smaller bouncing projectiles after the first one. It can help you clear entire waves at once. because Ivern is support-style jungler, gets to build support items pretty cheap, and got the early Moonstone there with the classic Dark Seal. Uh-oh. Mass getting jumped on here, the abscond, the abduct, the immediate crash down to follow it up. But Immortals are keeping their mid laner alive, a massive amount of AoE, the spiraling despair has found local targets. Dove dies first, Mast stays alive, Rich misses the target and he barely finds the kill in the back end But now, Castles made his rotation into the fight here too, RMAO with a Root Caller and Rich is about to drop. Immortals outplay him and slay him baby. The underestimated way and they do not live to tell the tale. The Ivern with the moonscreen. Stone completed, empowered shields, keeping them alive. And our male flashes for the root caller to make sure they get two of them. Let's take another look at just how much. he's able to shield here. So, as he's getting charged in on, big double one comes in, then he gets out the Daisy as well. And even though he had charmed up, look at this, massive AoE. Matt's kiting back. He's able to put out so much. Another shield comes up from Armao. They're able to save him long enough that they get the two kills and by the time Rich comes in here. here with the flash ultimates. He's got no team left, and Armao's able to flash follow him. Rootcaller to allow the rest of the team to pick it up, and the grubs. will go their way. And Hui's passive is designed for fights like that. Being able to trigger the ability explosions on multiple clumped up enemy champions, that situation. Ended up great for Immortals. They're up 1,000 gold and a Drake so far Yeah, really really exactly the type of fight that Immortals want where Mass gets to tank it up with Multiple Ivern shields, giant AOE damage coming through, giving them one of the neutral objectives as well afterwards. And now they're taking over jungle here. There went the ulti, I have to say the name out loud because it wasn't really used for anything cool. We're not going to overdo it. Wait for you later. I'm just waiting for your big moment. I gotta I gotta pick my moment man I gotta pick my moment. That was not the moment Immortals just continuing to push up here. There's that molten fissure. I was talking about like once you have all the levels in the queue once you have a little bit of AP you just kind of blast the Wave and go look for something else to do. Yeah, it's one of the big difficulties for this Dignitas comp as the jungles already and taken over. XU gets pushed out, but he got his Gromp. Now huddle behind the tower as that turret plate. You know Tactical wants this turret plate so bad. He's so close to it who will get it before the 14 minute mark for sure as they get to push in afterwards here But does start to get really hard for dig because one of the things they're lacking with this team comp is the wave clear like we highlighted earlier on they're fairly short range except for Tomo except for the dragon everybody is melee there and so you're going going to be, you got to come from different angles and try not to give this way too many nice setups here. Yeah. You have a big problem if. Aoe comes down from ole he sets it up Ivern slows come down from the shields popping off of them as well and and your your melee's get Massively AoE down, but the dragon is a scaling Tomo at 90 now at 13 and a half minutes into the game He's on pace. Well, he's gonna have to make sure he does not lose that pace. Essence Reaver completed at his first item, too. I know you were thinking about builds, so gonna go with that one that Garen. not only do you get the Sheen proc on your Qs, but now they're refunding more mana than they cost. Yeah, and if you do go for the Essence Reaver start, then you're gonna need to go for the Navori Quick Blades to follow up. that one up. Armao. Armao getting caught here in a 3v2. The burst from Dove is enough and the shutdown goes to the Dignitas mid laner. Nice pickup. That brush right there. the banana brush by the herald slash grub slash baron pit the void pit there's a lot of people living in this one apartment now it's it's a really crowded pit now Honestly though getting control wards into that brush early on in the game almost always pays dividends rich Okay, the 1v1 castle trying to flash it out And he does it! Rich does not have the power of God and anime on his side. Castle is too strong. Even with the Blade of the Ruined King finish there, loses the all-in. Castle Aatrox, you said it, brings it home again. And since they did get three of the grubs, he has a little bit of extra pushing power with the damage over time. We'll get a huge reward here Solo outer tower in addition to the solo kill feels good man one one and two here on this guy up 500 gold over his opponent took out the turret should be able to go back to base and acquire that completed profane hydra massive power spike my favorite my favorite that thing is So juicy big burst damage, but here's a look at it, and I think the big part is going to be the q3 So there's q1 castle nice flash over God, he hits all of them. Yeah. Good pat, he got the passive auto before the ult too and then Q3s backwards right on top of him cause he knows where Yone's gonna land. And that ultimate's coming through and the Q3 is coming down on your head. Very well read there by Castle, knowing how to play against those... high-mobility champions and you could see the frustration on Rich's face. He's like damn. Yeah, he got me completely outplayed Topside overloaded here with dig nice rotation from them They bring over the jungle support from mid lane to allow dove to get his outer tower as well Get some more money into this Silas who by the way brought of ages got some nice Buffs on the patch as well. Yes, sir. A little bit of extra HP and mana on that one for him Okay, still a very close game here both games so far today not had these runaway early games for either side as we'll see Immortals pick up another Drake for themselves. Dignitas are not doing super great in the neutral objective contest here so far. But remember, they did get the Herald off the back of their previous pick on our Mayo. We're still yet to see what they can accomplish with that. This is so fun. We're going to get to test Ziggs. carry scaling, with an Ivern on her team by the way, to buff her up, versus the Omega Dragon scaling, and 16-40 into the game. 128 now here. Okay. Again, we're still looking, every scaling point is nice, but you know the- 225. You know the big one. It's 225. You know 225 is what everybody's looking at. here, and especially once you get your quick blades too, don't underestimate reducing the cooldown on your flap flap flap, the kiting ability. of the smolder is huge for later because the synergies there when you're able to reduce the cool down and keep it going as we get the charges keep on going here. tier two. Mask is gonna take the tier one of Dignitas on the opposite side of the map at the same time, just letting that turret finish off as many of the minions as possible while he hits the wave. So there you go. game still just so close between these two squads we're two and a half minutes away from baron spawning on the rift and we've got smolders still stacking up he what It was five minutes for Evolution 1, 16.45, you set it for Evolution 2, and most players wanna try to get this in the low 20s for the 2.25. You really need that true damage. to feel like you're living your best life as a little baby Jax. Definitely agree there. Um, honestly, this game, I just feel like Iver is going to do so much work flowers so much potential here with redemption finish second this is this is one of the uh preferred builds with Giant melee clumps if you get a redemption huge value from healing up Not only your team in your front line here trying to hold the line where you're throwing shields into Castle, you're throwing the Redemption down to keep him going, make sure that squishier Lethality Aatrox stays upright, but you're going to get huge value over all these Dignitas members too. It just feels like that's the kind of thing that's going to be a part of the future. like the team fight of Immortals has so much potential to be able to destroy them, that Dignitas gotta continue to look for some of these aggressive. Rest of angles and the vision these wards are going to be a problem for them. They've been scouted They've been seen and immortals here moving in yeah, but they didn't have the damage close enough immediately. It was our Mayo and Olay far up while Mask and Tactical were trying to catch up. So Dignitas had enough time to disengage. And yeah, worth pointing out, If we take the smallest values possible from the redemption, it's 200 health restored to allied champions, 10% max HP true damage to enemies. If you got all 10 dudes in a circle, that's a 2,000 HP swing between the damage being done and the health being healed with minimum values. Intense stuff, we'll see how much value. Our mayo can get out of that as the game moves on under two minutes until the next Drake is taken It's another mountain rift and it's a 2-0 lead for Immortals there. Do you think dig tries to stop him from getting? soul point or do you just say nope we got to wait on smolder 225 fight him for soul honestly i really want that smolder 225 okay i feel like that is the win con here for Dignitas it does so much when you get that extra burn you have the execute as well and Dignitas like they will have a massive engage you know it's going to be explosive. They're either going to win in a big way or they're going to lose in a big way. And I have had a lot of faith here in XU's engages already on the So maybe they do find the angle. Maybe they do get that dream Yone follow-up, you know, Rell plus Yone combinations and Rakan Yeah, Isles has definitely been Been performing so far this year in the LCS and him with flash is always deadly Ole wants to keep trying to fight these guys Best for the vision in the topside river. Baron is live on the rift now. 20 minutes, 30 seconds into the game. Another 45 or so to go until that Drake spawns. As we can see, couple of. Resets coming out as everybody wants to go back, get their vision, complete their items. If you know a team fight's coming up, you gotta be ready ahead of time. Recall now for Tomo. I assume he's probably. probably got the money for the Navori Quick Blades. He goes back, and yep, there it is. Okay, two-item power spike for him. Two-item power spike for the Sylas. We already talked about two items for Ivern, but he buys, he buys cheap stuff. Two items for the Aatrox here as well. Hey, two item discounts, still two items when they're this impactful. Kind of nice in the offseason, they gave some little buffs to a lot of the support items. So Ivern got to benefit from that as well as Olleh here with the shield. trying to fight that vision fight. Romero just spamming them. Astle, not afraid to jump over the wall. Olleh throws out the Eclipse there, ready to make sure that he can tank up. Pipe breaks out, but Dignitas does not want to full commit to anything here just yet. Tactical will try to find whatever poke he can with the zap, as Mask wants to push out the mid lane, but Tomo's happy to answer. 200. They're gonna find the flowers. They're gonna find the dragon 200 stacks if immortals can force a fight before he hits 225 It could really change the landscape of things here as X used behind enemy lines A TP coming in from Digg to reinforce, but the whole crew is there from Immortals chasing after XU. Rootcaller thrown out at the very last second, but XU can get away in time. Dignitas grouping back up together here in the bot side river now I gotta say it didn't look like much, but that is really big immortals castle specifically going to try and mark him and getting that Rell flash blown, finding him on the side. Good awareness from Immortals, they know they're just looking out for these flanks for the all-in for Dig. explosive engage and castle goes to mark the the critical component of that now with no flash on x you it's going to be much more difficult for them to actually make the huge play. Here comes the mob! Immortals trying to stand tall in the river now as Olay is in the middle of two. Massive AoE wombo combo coming up at the top as Dubs tries to dive in and Mass grabs the kill back of the Isles. is shut down the dragon damage is pouring in 232 stacks ready to go as castle tries to fight dub not enough HP to keep this one going it's two dead on both sides, a 3v3 in the bot side river, but health bars favor Dignitas. through these mountain dragons. Tomo's there poking around. They want to wait for it though. No jungle smite for them. And they're too scared of an Armao steal. They back off after the leash. Flowers, he got the stacks now after the team fight. He is working through it. Now we're going to see Smolder. really shine. Here's another look at the engage though. So they got the nice low at the top level like you called out. Mom came to follow it up. And then on the top side, Dove... Dove is working his way through castle, while Olleh went in for the counter engage, and Rich just over the top finishes it off, so they get this big explosion. Tactical and Armao got got chumped out and had to run away super early on. But we aren't done. We're ready to go. Tomo and the rest of Dignitas starting up the dragon. Tomo just gonna keep spitting those fireballs, try to poke however he can. The drake down to about 5,000 HP the bomb comes in over the top as it only hits only not a lot of value coming out From that one dragon still at 4k Dignitas trying to keep the health bars high, but immortals are doing the same thing. Rich versus Castle here in the bot side. River as Castle takes the burst, but Rich disengages back over the wall. Olleh ready to follow up here with the engage. XU locked down, but Immortals have to back away. The clone way paints a masterpiece, and it's written in the blood of Dignitas. Rich tries to stay alive as Dove wants to escape back of the wall. He won't be sniped down, but it ain't gonna matter Tomo and Dove still alive There's a one-man advantage for Immortals Dove still trying to get away as mask wants to chase him Not quite enough range to get that done here yet. Wanted to see about a snipe. Again, Dove getting that wave shoved up. The Drake now finally going to be finished off by a I feel like this was a four-minute Drake scene, man. It was! It was! That was part two. This was a sequel here from the Dignitas of Morgan. those banger flowers. I love live patch. We have so much to go over in this. Look at that engage. The root caller actually delayed. dubs follow-up so it could have been even bigger for dig but way damage explodes on Dignitas as they're grouped up after it even with the Giant engage and then Castle gets the run through them chasing them off So much fun here trying to keep up with uh, all of the extra explosions and in the middle of it all, too. Well, there you go. 5.4 K the way explosions. That's what we kept warning about. The massive AoE potential of this Immortals lineup that they've drafted here in these mid and late game teamfights. He's so scary if everybody just wants to kill him. to have a meatball wrestling match. not gonna connect in time on the back end of things remember that spell will do bonus damage if you are immobilized or isolated and the bonus damage is a bunch it's like a rocket Yeah, you don't want to get hit by a lot of people too pretty popular in solo queue is going home for the horizon focus Never mind though as X you was flanked around. They're gonna teleport go for the class. Needed just yet castle trying to fight in the middle of four. He needs the q3 to come down for the healing But he's gonna be shut down by Toma before it happens Dignitas just killed two and one of them's the 80 carry now they have health bars a little bit dicey here for Isles and Dove but they're heading back over to Baron what a call from Dig there the game on the edge and they're gonna be able to make the critical pick Tactical and Castle, Bolt, down, Isles here, very low, doesn't have ult, but they're going to teleport Rich right back in. They want to bring Dove back into this fight, he had to go back and heal, but he did. The Unleashed TP is ready to go. Immortals do not want to lose their remaining three players. Dove steals away a cloned Daisy, and Baron goes to Dignitas. Dignitas. They may be down dragons, but they're up in gold, they're up baron now, and they should be able to get more afterwards. Duff here trying to push with Daisy. Mass gonna have to be careful. Gotta respect the Daisy knock-ups. Finally gonna kill that one off. Pier 1 turret still being just chipped down by this cannon minion. Blessed by Dove, one more, oh no, he got distracted. Yeah, the stolen away AP Daisy, gives her some extra oomph there, and Dove will be able to keep it, keep up the pressure here. out a turret number one see if they can get bottom lane moving as well for Dignitas because the rest of the team has gotten their full reset and their purchases Tomo's went for the rapid-fire cannon This by the way since your Q range on smolder is the same for your auto-attack Then it increases your Q range for the rapid fire, and you can get some nice long-range fireballs poke going for tomo especially now that he's got the upgrades the extra true damage this dragon is scary man 307 stacks let me Look at what that says then so every cue which is on a 2.2 second cooldown if you don't hit something with the boy cooldown reduction 6.5% max HP true damage over three seconds if you drop below nine boom you're dead that you add those two together it's 15% if he hits you and you are at 15% HP it'll take you a couple seconds but you're dead that's almost elder move over zary we've got a new late game yeah this guy is going to be trouble for immortals the further this game goes but right now it's immortals that are having to respond to Digg. Dignitas are driving the car and they're headed straight for the IMT structures. All right. A couple more hits. Bottom lane too has worked worked up here rich on the level 16 Yone bottom putting pressure on castle with these barrened up minions whittling away at bottom tower Wow the mid lane tower was slowly being whittled down but they know they have to get ready they have to get reset and ready for this dragon because while they are now Almost 5,000 gold for Digg. They're still facing multiple dragon souls that they're gonna have to deal with in this game. Even if they defend this first one, they constantly have. to be worried about this objective coming up so did get their reset off in order to prepare for dragon. All right let's see it man 20 seconds Dignitas want to keep control going the baron is going to last just long enough for the drake to first spawn tomo is happy to just be left on his own to farm up all these waves get all those free stacks that's to late game smolder with a mobility with your cooldown reduction from your quick blades on your flat flat flap this feels like he's able to kite so well Well, yeah, and with all the melee protection here. They do have a lot of peel Oh, hey gonna take a lot of birds here for the front line. It's not tacky enough. Leona's already dead rich win in the creates space to guarantee the kill, then he can use the soul unbound to reset his position and get right back out. Now Castle, immediately losing half HP there to the Smolder, has to retreat. Dignitas, I would have to think they've all but secured their Drake here, as Mass gets to flash out, the mom damage over the top Again, not gonna find any huge payoff, but Immortals have all already been forced back. Yep, that's gonna be Dragon defense number one, complete for Dignitas. Security here. Dragon poke in middle. down. Easy drake pickup and they retain pressure in both mid and bottom. Immortals trying to farm up there. Zeri, tactical here. Doing his best with the new Static Shiv this game. You know, still possibilities of trying to have a Zeri moment later on into the game. Yeah. Once you get a couple more. You know items coming through here. He's already on three has his own quick blades Our mail went with the staff of flowing water for the extra AP and move speed buff here Which is very good to put on mask as well for the positioning for the way for the amplification there, too So we'll see immortals their hopes still alive in this game they do have the advantage in wave clear of course they are the ones with the way they've got some nice bits of range here they've got the electric city on their side as well. So they're trying to stall it out. They're trying to continue to farm it up here. But it's just ominous when you're across the rift from a small And now it's a four item completed smolder with the armor penetration from Lord Dom's coming in It's Tomo's time to shine, baby Yeah, he's set to carry, man. And I agree, I think that Immortals, yeah, you can still win, but everything's gotta be set up perfectly. Hui needs massive AoE, Zeri needs to have that Zeri moment as the Midlane tier 2 turret falls, Dignitas keep their push going. of games where like he got that azir quadra and they were trying to come back but then they didn't get the comeback so i didn't get a lot of the credit there but his sylas is actually He's literally almost about to complete a deathcap, he's got two of the needlessly large rods, he's up to 17 now. He's got the extra amplification here, the lich bane as well. has been doing work in a lot of this burst coming through. So we'll see. Currently, they're splitting up into the 1-3-1 for Dignitas, both Dove and Rich with their teleports. Ready. And looks like Dove himself up to the tower with that Lich Bane. Nice little chunk here. I mean when you look at the 11 kills of Dignitas... Khan's been there for nine of them, Silas for 10 of them, Rell for all 11. This setup here has been pretty fantastic for these guys in the fights, all working together for these efforts. They still have to crack the enemy base. There's 13 seconds until Baron spawns again. Tomo trying to make sure he does not get caught. XU speeding him up, just making sure they can both walk away from him. from this one all right we're cool we're chill okay look all these wards that you could teleport flank on too though as immortals push out yeah they need to collapse back into their own territory here. Nice move from Immortals. They know it's getting a little dangerous on the other half of the map. It's been in Dignitas control for so long, it's littered with wards. Control over the top side river, control over the baron pit. A TP coming in, they want to make sure that everybody's ready to join in for this one. Dove has the stolen Hui ulti that's spiraling. spare that incredibly effective clumped up team fighting tool Dignitas are not going to start the Baron just yet they're going to wait for Immortals to approach and hope to punish Castle wants to walk up here from this angle, but he's got to be careful. Tomo, again, they're going to put some damage into Oleg. Castle could be caught, as Rich and X, you both go in, but they ain't going to find the mark. Smaller ulti goes wide, Immortals. They're going to be healed and shielded by Armao's Ivern, but now Rich wants to drive in. It's Ola right in the middle of everybody, but Tomo's ready to counter attack. Castle wants the smolder, but he ain't going to find him. Tomo's already killed off two, and now Immortals, where can you even go? A triple kill back to Smolder. Dignitas are ready to march it down mid for the Nexus. Yeah, I think Immortals gonna- to have to go back to the gray screen. Dignitas knocking on the front door. Rich keeping the dive alive as Tactical has to flash out just to survive it. Dignitops with a five-man push, keeping things going. 419 stacks on the Smolder, level 18 now. They should just brute force this down. 10 seconds. on Olleh, 25 on the two solo laners of Immortals as Tactical will not live through it. Iles and the rest of Dignitas will get this done. He will tie Immortals in the standings and take them out in 34 minutes. Dignitas! Another victory over Immortals, the first ones to use Smolder, and a really exceptional performance on the Sylas from Dove. Yes, sir, bringing it all together so much fun to watch both of these squads I will dominate actually had a really nice tweet about the LCS in the level here of the players in this split, really leading to the thought process of, anyone can be anyone right now. These teams are really scrappy and they've. showed in a lot of these games, some really strong team fighting. I also like that we got to see some high moments for Hue, even though there wasn't. a victory for Immortals. There were some real pop-off moments in those team fights where he got that ideal situation and really showcased the strengths of the champion. I hope we get to see. both of these champions some more. I agree with you, it's part of the fun of live patches. You just always get to see the newest and most exciting things happening and getting to see these two go head-to-head. in their debut for LCS for both was a lot of fun.

Right now we're headed to break before 100 Thieves versus TL, but first let's take a look at this year's first RU. you Smarter Than featuring a brand new host. as many items that build from this specific item. These guys are nerds. I am going to give you eight players, put them in order from youngest to oldest. My suit! This time it's, are you smarter than LCS Pro? Because analysts, we got them out here, they don't know shit. We have FlyQuest versus Dignitas. here. We're gonna start off with new champions. I am going to start to read an ability to you. You have to say the champion and the ability. Each of your teams. Vote who's your first victim up here. You will not know anyway. None of us will know. It's not me, bro. I don't know any of us. All right. Hands behind your back. Oh, that's important. Yes.  What's in fissure? That is Huey Q E Yup, 2 points to Michael You guys had a good run There's nothing offensive about this, really? All right, maybe we'll be seeing some support Hui from FlyQuest. Who's next? Okay, I go next? Yeah. You can't just keep sending Bucio up. now. I'm sure. I know the meta. All right, Crimson Curse. Can you lose points if you guess wrong? You do not lose points if you guess wrong, but... If you guess wrong, it goes automatically to the other team and they can tell themselves. Can I press his button? No. Since you do not know it, you still can't discuss it with your team. I'm going to now. read the ability, and give you the ability type for one point. This champion gains 0% to 50% based on missing health, increased healing, based on her missing health and her attacks and abilities apply. Briar passive. Yes. Nice. Thank you. Thank you. I would have never known. All right, I'm getting in there. Oh, GG. It might be lost. Yeah, it's going to have been a feeling now, people. Yeah, physically. Cheese! All right. Crushing Ma. yes I've seen a fairy nope so you guys now get to discuss amongst yourselves for two points so if they if you you can talk to them I got better. I got better. I got inspired. I think it's Brian. I think it's me the one way. He's like screamer That's new. That's something spritz Rachel scream. I think it's fine. They don't know like look at them. Oh, yeah It's Swae Lee. It's Swae Lee. Swae Lee? Okay, okay. I think. Alright, answer? Swae Lee? Yes! We knew it! We knew it! Alright. Who's here?  Yeah, I think I can't win this matchup apparently. It's just one darkened daggers Yes I got the easy one, let's go! He was fast! When can I take my hands out of my back? Like the moment you say the first letter of the question? Yep! Certain death! I'm sorry guys, we're on the up and up, we're on the up and up. for champions. Ready? Eviscerate. The Fury E? Yes. Wow! Bro, I played him in ARAM two days ago. First time ever. Wow, these guys are nerds. That just wraps up round one. We'll see you after next game. Look what I just made. The perfect... Not too bad, but check this out. Hmm. Whoa. I love it. A true Venus clam. Red Bull gives you wings. The new Red Bull Sea Blue edition with the taste of Juneberry. Wings for every taste. Thanks for watching! Thank you very much for watching.  🔥🔥🔥🔥 What's up everyone? I've got the victorious Tomo here for this interview after a win. How is that game from your perspective? It felt hectic as hell. Yeah, I think we made a lot of blunders early game, but thankfully our team confidence is pretty strong. I have smolder so I just 1v9 late game as you saw so yeah. You had like something like 422 stacks at the end like we expected if there was going to be a older player, it would be you. It felt like you were playing the pick and solo queue a lot even before. You guys were scouting me? A little bit. We were aware. So we were watching. Just your thoughts on the champion overall because now you got finally got to pull it out first smolder in LCS First region to be able to play it. Yeah, I was playing in scrims a lot and it just felt really good for our team in general I think it fits our play style and yeah I really enjoy the champion I think it's really exciting and fun to play so it just helps with that too just like it's more engaging to play I've seen a lot of bad smolders out there in solo queue. Can you give us any tips or tricks, anything that you've seen people mess up on the most that you learned on your week and a half? I guess I'm playing a champion. Honestly, just just farm. You're really fragile early game Obviously like you're a little dragon. You just want to farm camps, you know, like later on I was just eating every single My jungler just like offered everything to me. So yeah, just scale once you get size you're just broken I think that was the trick because of course I guess Ola chased you on a like second base Got you on a kill on the bush? Yeah, we don't talk about that. We don't talk about that. From that point forward, your comp's like, give me all side lanes and farm at that point? Yeah. It's especially important on the fourth Q Evolve, so 225 stacks. It was like a dragon fight I think third dragon or something. It was a pretty game-changing. I got it like mid-fight fight so then we actually it contributes to winning us the fight. Sweet I appreciate the tips thanks again you're for sure gonna be on this stage again we got hundred and TL in the house. next. Thanks, guys. Have a good one. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! You Welcome back, y'all. Oh, we got a little caster swap-a-roo in time for game three. It's your boys Raf and Azale once a back Again, and as we get ready for this draft, we saw our first way and smolder picks in the LCS with some crazy fire coming between both teams, but now with 100 Thieves and Team Liquid on the horizon here, one of the things we have to look at right away is that Before, when they first met up in the very first week of the LCS, we had high expectations for Team Liquid against 100 Thieves. Swindler man! Boo! Come on, 100 Thieves! what Dignitas we're cooking they're like we cannot allow this to the draft guys yeah I was hoping we were gonna get a castle smolder game cuz I've been playing a fair bit of this champ and I think it is really really strong it is definitely a lot of fun to watch we're on 14-3 first week of it it's gonna be a banger yeah but as I was saying before 100 Thieves the first time they met up against Team Liquid they were touted as the not favorite team, and they completely came back against Team Liquid and showed us that these guys have a lot more than what they were really perceived to be before the season started.  I mean the end of the first round robin hundred thieves they are tied for second place way above Where everyone had them in this standing so it is really exciting. We got some Fans from Korea for OMT, respect. Let's go! They're here for the fearless admiral! Oh my goodness. The general himself. We'll see how TL is going to be. doing today it's gonna be a fun matchup I think you know between these two teams impact and sniper this was our season opener here these two players going up against each other it was The Blind Pick Riven, I believe it was, game, if we remember. Counterpick. It was counterpick, excuse me. Up against Impact. I believe that was one of the only losses he actually had on the Udyr. He was playing in the Udyr. Was a game a TL was winning hundred thieves are able to bring it back for some really great double TP plays some good flanks That were able to turn things around but No Udyr for impact in this one and Udyr has just been going crazy in the LCS coming into this week It was 10 and 2 in the LCS. It was basically every win for TL was Impact playing on Udyr, this guy has been playing it every single time it's up. He is going to be on the Kassante this time around, and Yone will get his hands on the Kalista which is a really high priority. It's going to be interesting to see if it's going to be a lane pairing, you know, more of those range supports alongside it, or if it is going to be more of an aggressive kind of old school engage style that we used to see a lot more. It's something that we've already seen. Oh, I like this. In the past games, losses were when they tried to go for more early focus games. Trying to prioritize the Lucian and just try to steamroll the game. Those didn't really work out in their favor. The games that they have won, a lot of late game priorities. So this one, Team Liquid, they don't want to just be identified as... Well, if we don't scale, then we lose, right? So Team Liquid trying to have a little bit more of that early game pressure and try to prove against the 100 Thieves that they can actually beat them with something that is. Proactive early. Yeah, see with a smolder record tracker on the poster in the in the stick cadence What I want to see is can you track the stacks, you know, that'd be a hard poster to update If you haven't put a lot up there, but we are getting the Vi and Taliyah. Taliyah buffed on this patch We saw NRG running this combo earlier did not work out that well for him But I do think it's a great answer to collect Callista, when you are on that unraveled earth, if you are hopping around, it is very, very difficult. You know, you can get locked down by that, by point and click engage, try to. clip in that Kalista, burst her down. If you try to use a Q or anything like that as the Kalista on that Unraveled Earth, you are gonna get stunned up, you know, with that little hop from the Q. Yep. obviously you know Varus pretty strong later here so maybe seeing some of these potential jungle pairings getting banned away or rather support pairings the Olaf gonna get taken out away from sniper we saw one game i believe from him it is something that a lot of pros who are comfortable playing these aggressive matchups do really like as one of those into kasante yeah it is something that you can run over of course see you have a lot of true damage on the E, but you can kind of just really brawl very very heavily with the Kassante, and you can kind of just run this guy down, Kassante is definitely I think a lot weaker these days than some of the 1v1s. Kobe, our Volibear one-trick in the house, made it all the way to Grandmaster last season. Yeah, true. Shoutouts to Kobe. me man grinding on a champion that most junglers would never ever pick in this meta or you know maybe for quite some time a lot of movement speed items are gone but as we close out this second draft phase. I want to highlight, for 100 Thieves, as you already pointed out, this Vi-Taliyah combo is going to be a huge, huge threat for Team Liquid's carries. Kalista as well but for Orianna because yeah that cease and desist easy combo to lock in for the Taliyah's full burst I want to see what team liquid is going to round out this Composition with I imagine that if you want to go for that lane prio you want to go for something like an enchanter support for 4jj Yeah, absolutely could do that, but Nautilus also really is very powerful you know these sorts of pairings do give you that hard engage this is kind of what the old-school way of playing Kalista was people would always pair it with Nautilus or Alistar these types of hard engage picks Nowadays, they've been playing a lot more with enchanters Renata. I always think is kind of that best pairing with it, but it is fanned away Said to one a looking like that will be the lock so gonna give themselves a little bit more time to decide what they want for that counterpick down in bot lane. If you're trying to win the 2v2, you want to see what support 100 Thieves are going to be going towards. 100 Thieves obviously need their top lane, they need their support, so they're going  to make some decisions here. Maokai support is still quite strong on this patch, and there's a tiny, tiny chance of him playing top. I've been seeing a couple people mess around with the top lane again but I think if it gets locked it's almost 100% chance going to support yeah we'll have to see what hundred thieves last pick of the draft is make sure, but if it were something like a Maokai it would add on to how many point-and-click tools you have to watch something slippery down like this Kalista, which to be honest close so far, that is going to be... to be the most consistent damage threat that Team Liquid have in their pocket. So Aatrox is going to be the pick here for Sniper, Aatrox and Lissandra, pretty solid matchup, you can definitely see scale well into this you know generally it's considered to be pretty strong in a tanks you have a good amount of sustain it's difficult for tanks kind of wear you down on their own right we have been seeing a trucks do really poorly in the LCS this split, but largely it has been into Udyr, which is just such a strong early laner that even though Aatrox is considered good in tanks, you kind of just lose to Udyr anyway. It's not the same story here with Kassante. So I do think it's going to be a preferential matchup for Sniper up in the top lane. And we have Alistar as the pick here for Aayla, so looking for a little bit of hard engage there. More set up for that to lead to a win. You're not just gonna be relying on that buy ultimate the engage can come through from Alistar set up things like the Varus ultimate the Varus Q and flips in as well. Of course if he goes back to Taric this is something that he was actually really well known for. This was back to the Doublelift days when he was playing with Doublelift they did a lot of I want to say it was Sona-Taric one of the kind of first bot lane lanes in our league that we're doing a lot of that and we're gonna get the Taric pick here this is first of the split I believe for definitely for core and I want to check if it's first like total I'm gonna double check on that but this is something that he is very comfortable with it's a really strong scaling support it's very very powerful as well You know with that Callista to be able to have that ultimate in you give you that safety to go aggressive You use that Carrick ultimate offensively ideally so you try to start off the fight you try to look to get really high value from that especially against a team that has really telegraphed hard engage as soon as the vial starts flying in I can't cancel that and say just kidding yeah And as long as you keep you alive, you could potentially, with good timing, deny that whole Vi-Taliyah combo that they've been drafting for. So really excited to see how they're going to play this out. The weakness, of course, is... that Taric is not a super strong laner you don't have a lot of presence in lane right but that being said against melee supports like the Alistar as long as you're getting those autos out for the passive cooldown reduction to be able to get more heals more ease out you can still have quite a bit of value right and I have to say the pivot from Nautilus into Alistar for Aayla gives a little bit of flexibility as well because normally once you go in with Nautilus, you're also kind of in there with Vi. But with Alistar, if you want to just punt someone away, or knock off someone as they go in for the entrance, that is at least some peeling ability that you have. you'll have, and it's more flexibility for this overall 100 Thieves composition, but as you pointed out, Cosmic Radiance on the side of CoreJJ, great timing on that, can deny... so much burst in that early burst of damage from the side 100 Thieves as they look for the initial pick, which allows for that second fight to be super successful for them. did check it out to confirm. It is not only the first Taric pick of the LCS, it's the first Taric pick this season of any of the top four major regions, so no one has picked it yet. So another one. LCS has been really popping off with so many different unique picks this year. It has been really fun to watch. And CoreJJ gonna add another one to the list here. With the Tarik and we're heading on into game hundred these versus TL Week for the LCS, you know what? We got a shout-out mark Z once again. Thank you commish It's only because of you we're getting Taric in this game. There's no other reason. I refuse to believe it as yep And if they lose direct all complaints to at the mark Z on DMs are open on Twitter. He loves that All right as we take to the rift first opening seconds of the game nothing too fancy here, it's just a Defensive line of scrimmage from both sides maybe quit goes in for a little bit of poke here But it's just the standard emote game from APA. He throws out the tonic wood. We'll look for the reset. Yeah Yep, Quid gonna be looking for that reset. It's gonna be really interesting to see how he actually performs on this. Taliyah, again, as I mentioned, did get some buffs on this patch. They're gonna help a lot with The push, the base damage on your Q went up, which is very significant, you know, even though it is only a small number, it was increased by about 10, I believe. Because you were spimming out, it's very significant. Also the E cooldown got flat reduced to I believe 14 at all ranks now. So the wave clear is a lot better and when Taliyah can get out of lane it is so impactful to be able to move around the map to really be able to make things happen, so gonna be interested to see who gets pushed, is it still gonna be the Orianna as you would expect the previous patch, or will those buffs have shifted things enough that Quidd could actually be the one getting pushed. first round Robin match, but where are you kind of looking at first in these few opening rounds? I think you're gonna be watching bot lane you know I do think these bot lanes are gonna be pretty spicy and anytime you have Kalista if it gets ahead of the pace of the game, it's gonna be important. But we also have to be looking up towards top lane. You know, that Riven, the first time around that I talked to you about, this was Sniper and Impact in 2016. In 2016, this is a 10-year-old sniper, and this was not the career debut for Impact, by the way. He played, and his debut was back, I want to say it was 2012 or 2013. 13 in Korea, so Sniper would have been like six when Impact started playing Pro League, which is crazy to think. You also have to get so. much respect over to Impact. It's not just that he's been playing for a long time, this guy has been dominating at the top level for so long, has won so many championships, has won championships on three different rosters I want to say in the LCS alone has gone to international continue to keep that level of play up so it is so cool to have you know one of our absolute greatest veterans in the entire game Not even just in the LCS, this guy has been so good for so long. And then he is going up against Sniper, one of the absolute youngest players, this kind of rising star who has so much promise, and it'll be really fun to see who comes out on top of this because Impact was very confident that Sniper wasn't really gonna be able to do much of anything against them last time but Sniper came out on top so yeah Impact definitely is going to be wanting to lose again yeah it's the exciting contrast and it shows how long our esport has been around for the fact that you can have someone like impact with such a 10 career now playing against someone who has been a hyped up prospect that we've known about since he was 12 13 years old first hitting challenger and when upon making his debut guys Picked Riven against Impact. And won. And he won. Now. He refused to elaborate. He refused, you know what, you're right. Refused to elaborate. Let the results dictate that. But it's definitely it's definitely wild it's been interesting right because I think that when we've talked to a lot of the top laners They're like, yeah snipers not that good. You know, they're not that impressed by him, you know, but his his results I think have been speaking for themselves. I think he's doing a lot better than people were expecting. Most people that I was talking to you know prior to the split were saying yeah he's gonna have a rough start you know he's not there. yet. We think he could get there, but he's not there yet and it's gonna be a tough beginning of his career in the LCS. You know, maybe should have taken another split in Academy or something like that, but here he is and he is performing Performing on stage, you know, has been doing well. And this priest is in power rankings. I was also wrong my bad. Also. Shout out to Davis I knock who put me on blast as well. It's like it's okay like hundred these came with a vengeance and they are really pulling a heist so far in this first season, first round robin record. Yeah, absolutely. It's also fun, you know, just talking about the top lane, there's so much to talk about because they have such a different style, these two players. In the shared champion pool, very little share between these two players, just like Asante in fact. The impact has been very much back to the tanks, a lot of talk about how strong tank items are. Minimization is in this season King of Rooker and frozen heart, you know plushes Bomby that has become kind of the big three that every tank is rushing for and impact has kind of been you know Having that Rescue for success. We're over on the other side. It's very clearly more towards that aggressive play different style of champions coming out from sniper That's the style that he is kind of made made his own and what he really wants to be known for. Neither jungler has made an inclination to really play for it quite yet But most of the push has been favoring hundred thieves so far after this last shove in but there's a moment where they're looking for a reset. Do Team Liquid want to try and find a dragon here? It looks like they are going to, you know, especially if that bot lane does reset. I have to say though, Jann is basically tapped on mana. as well, River now has info that this is going on. And it is 100 Thieves with the bot lane push right now. Core is gonna make the first move over here. But again, Jann, basically out of mana. completely. Mid is in parity, this might just be a bit of a flip but it does look like Hunter Thiefs have made a decision. No, APA is gonna be moving down and that will force them to back off. of was super crucial for Team Liquid, because as you called out, Yawn was not high on combat power at the time, but having that 4 vs 3 potential advantage secures in the Dragon and becomes... because River committed that time over. Wait a minute, they might look for something here in the bot lane. UmTi, if he wants to look for Q into flash, not gonna commit it, just gonna play it cool. Yep, and River is there to cover, so. So you know, had he overcommitted like that, trying to go for a Q flash W, likely would have been really heavily punished here. Quidd trying to push up, potentially going to look for an angle to stop that recall. call but APA far enough back that it won't be able to happen and Quidd just gonna be trying to clear out this wave as fast as possible he knows he needs to hover his bot lane they know River could be around and River's gonna show River is still Charging up the queue, but as soon as Umti shows, River decides not to engage. This is really tricky, because as you already called it, Azale, once either Vi or Sejuani commit, if they cannot get out as there's a flash... already in the top side, Sniper off in the ultimate as well. Impact going all out as well. Lot of damage, Sniper wins the 1v1! What a flash there from Sniper as well. Impact try to knock him back into the tower and try to look for that ulti to go all out and pull him under the turret. But Sniper early flashes and it means that the Kassadin ult pulls him away from the turret. from the tower instead. And Sniper just pops the ulti, turns it around. We can watch this one more time. We've seen it a thousand times if you've seen it once. It is E4, Q3, try to W him back. of the turret then look for the all-out but that flash meant Impact is going the wrong way, he's low, he doesn't have the assistance that he was counting on from the tower and this is just great stuff here. from Sniper slams him down for the isolated first blood there in the top lane and he is looking happy about that. He's almost shocked he's like oh my god I just did that. Viper if you're watching right now, I cannot imagine how proud you are watching your little bro go from week one Super nervous on the LCS stage now solo kill killing the same opponent now in week four. I mean, their whole family is just insane at League of Legends. The Viper, you know, former LCS pro, Crimson, Challenger player. Sniper, now LCS Pro, all three brothers are Challenger. Those parents just need to have two more kids, then they can have a full LCS squad themselves. That could definitely be the angle. As Team Liquid are able to secure the Grubster themselves, UmTi still firm, we're in the front line, massive shockwave tries to bring them all in, but that unraveled, Orpheum quit, did a lot of damage, already taking down UmTi. APA forced the flash, but the flash committed as well. Quinn is just cooking up Team Liquid on a platter as now Core, JJ, and Impact are forced to run, but Core's not getting out. 100 Thieves are running away with the game on this. one yeah they are crushing him it's a three four zero on that top side after already getting this solo kill up in the top lane look at sniper now picks up another kill assists as well as TL we're trying to commit very heavily to this but they don't have a lot of damage here it's really just APA and three tanks so all hundred thieves have to do is keep APA out of the fight the shockwave was big but at the end of the day this is an early game Orianna and then you see this turn as soon as the APA steps forward for that shockwave he gets ulted by River and held that the entire time waiting for him knowing that Orianna was the only true threat. With him eliminated there's nothing the rest of the squad can do and they're looking happy. about it. 100 Thieves cruising early on in this game. Already a quick replay of both of the young solo laners from 100 Thieves popping off and having a good time. And I just have to say I might have been a mismanage. I'll hold up another fight on the top side sniper now to be one I don't think he's getting out of this one with a little bit of help impact gets the shutdown. Yeah nice They're up on the top side um T gonna get up towards top lane and this time as you say they're gonna be able to burst Them down. I think sniper likely was sitting on a fair bit of gold as well. We'll see if he does actually have a buy Sitting on 1,100 more gold so close that that one item completion so even though you know he is up a lot of gold He's not at that full combat power for JJ, and y'all still have flash so they're still safe. I thought it looked like maybe River was gonna try to all-in with that cease and desist but they have enough distance to get away. Yep, gonna be able to cleanse and walk it out so the Profane Hydra And now completed, that's the item that you're kind of waiting for, it is so powerful on the Aatrox. Really on a lot of champions, we've talked about it a lot, but because it has that bonus damage on the active... below 50% HP. Any champion with a lot of upfront burst, it's very easy to knock your opponent in these trade patterns down, and then try. Uh-oh, AP doesn't have flash from that grub. fight before. Easy combo for the Taliyah to follow up. Shockwave tries to hold him back, but he's still dead and gone. Taliyah looking good, showcasing the power of this combo. And that is something I want to say, you know, River is so good at, is punishing missing cooldowns. If you think back to that last game as there's a skirmish here. I think Corb maybe could walk it out. Hey, might have to flash here. It's the Fates call from Janna that keeps him safe and keeps the Summoner spell intact. That was actually so close though. Really held that ultimate long and another flip in there from quit. He is just kind of on fire right now But I don't think he's a single one here so far. It feels like it. Oh God Okay. Aayla igniting his former bot lane duo just saying nah buddy you can't back there. song come to LCS. That's crazy, I didn't even know he was here. Well, with that priority, 100 Thieves are just going to be able to get this second dragon of the game. Absolutely, but I really want to touch back on on the first game that they played against each other It was River on Vi and it was AP on Ziggs and he punished him so badly on the missing summoners Quit may have to be flashing out of this situation we'll see already using the prison their river engages core JJ flashes back but the cosmic radiant pops but team liquid don't have another way to engage so hundred they just get Get out. Yeah, exactly. And again, this game, you know, River now on the top side, they fight over by the Herald, Impact in trouble. Oh, but nice from Impact, using the all-out to dodge that last Q3 from Sniper. able to survive for now all pulling him back in the tower but no turret shot no punish this is a really scrappy game you know anytime I try to talk about it another fight breaks out That's the life of the color caster But yeah rivers just into anchor saying that actually punishing missing pulldowns. That's that's kind of the TLDR He did it in the previous game between these two teams was He's able to do it here again, you know, forced out the flash from APA with his ultimate that the Herald fight got the kill anyway, then immediately goes back mid, kills him again before flashes up. This is something this guy is really well known for. when you're talking to these other pros, he is so frustrating to play against, because he really understands the gank timings very, very well. Knows exactly when he can drop camps, when he can actually make these moves. to make something happen here with that priority both already gained from mid lane you get the grubs for free on the side of hundred feet so it denies team liquid from getting all six, as we're gonna get a chance to look at our Kia multi-lane on both mid jungle and bottom lane. Jann and Core having successfully pushed Meech off of the tower. because Alo went for a roam to cover mid lane during that time so it looks like they at least get one turret play out of it but the Grubs are awarded over 100 Thieves. to trade the grubs for that, so not that big a deal, you lose a plate on bot side. Yawn has not really been accelerated too much, he's actually going for a pretty defensive build here as well, he did go for the early Tabi's knows that it is going to be you know likely various by a truck all kind of rushing down towards him Engage from a love do they really want to take this one chain of corruption? No worries as well, but it's the teleport coming in. It's double teleporter sale both sniper and quitter arriving to the party a 4v2 on Bot lane y'all tried to pull in core J the Flash, it's not enough! Quidd takes him out! Both 100 Thieves youngsters, they're flashing forward to follow Sniper and Quidd. Instant response, that flash out. Romeon, they're able to burst him down, and gonna be able to get a nice punish here, take at least one plate away, and there could be an angle for a re-die, but they're not gonna risk it, because it is that Sejuani, very tanky. with the Frozen Heart already completed. Small victory on the top side, as it will be a play going the way of Impact to punish that TP down towards bot side from Sniper, but. 100 Thieves again going to be feeling really happy about this. So the carries from TL just feel like they can get no purchase in this game. You know, it's 0-2-0 for APA. on the bot side has not really been able to get the kind of prile that they wanted, has not had that lane dominance that they wanted, so both these guys have been put pretty far behind. are down cooldowns whereas 100 thieves the only one that could be exposed here is quid which is already why he is taking a defensive posture on that left lane no flashy on so that's who they may be going He's gonna have to position well. Let's see, Yawn is already stepping up, trying to see if he can stack the spear to help for that spear. But, as you called it out, Ayla is flanking around. APA has the guard, and meanwhile, Rift Herald is secured by T1. Liquid, but now they're pincered here as long as APA can guide them out safely. Alistar still looking for the flank angle, CoreJJ popping the Cosmic Radiance, all on the Sniper. They cannot take any bursts, but now the Cosmic Radiance is gone. They're still doing enough damage as they take out Mech. Sniper in the middle of all five, cannot get anything done. River's gonna be next. No one falls from Team Liquid! They survive! And the Taric ultimate from CoreJJ was massive for TL in that fight. Ayla had the flank angle, but the ulti lands from Core before he can actually get the combo off. They keep him alive, and it bought so much time for Yawn in this fight. APA does a good job marking Ale on the bot side of the screen, but then watch the timing here as it comes down. The Shockwave is there, that CC's up Sniper. Yawn survives right before that combo comes through. He's able to cleanse, he's able to kite back, he's able to burst them down. On the other side. Impact as well, was going crazy in the all-out. It's all down to that Taric timing. If you aren't engaged with Taric having that ultimate available, you have to be certain that you're gonna kill them before the- Taric ult does fall in this case hundred thieves not able to do it and TL from a deficit punish them Hugely getting a couple kills there for yawn, so Not only does he complete that Blade of the Ruined King, he's now got some extra gold to boot, going to be working towards a very likely Rageblade. 100 Thieves thought by taking the fight at Rift Herald. It was just a thought thinking it was a rehearsal dinner for them But Team Liquid showing what happens when you actually have your ultimates available for that fight and how the composition is supposed to be played out so now having experienced the brunt end of that side 100 Thieves have to be a little bit more calculated of when they are choosing to go in and waiting out those cooldowns. get that perfect initial engage, you kill off Yone or you kill off APA. There's probably not enough damage in the tank, you know, from that TL squad to be able to win through. And back to the sniper trading heavily here. to find CoreJJ looking for the Dazzle, the Flash, the Guarantee right on top of it. Quinn is in there as well, Weaver as well, but Ayla is buying time on the Yawn and APA. Yawn calls over CoreJJ with that Faithful against the two-man knockup as well. of the Dazzle Sun, River right on top of Yawn. No damage to follow up, Sniper's looking for it, but Yawn is kiting around, he's safe, APS also safe, Team Liquid running away with the fight once again, Quinn's in trouble, he's. It's gone! Team Liquid are smurfing on 100 Thieves! Forcing the play anyway, you know, we saw a river going with the ulti, but there's no flash on quit There's no flash on sniper sniper didn't even have his ultimate to try to follow up They can't get to the back line and actually get these kills and things are really starting to fall apart here. 400 Thieves after what was an incredible start, out of nowhere they're now down 2.5. 5K. They're down a dragon here and it's starting to look pretty tough for this hundredth-year squad who had a brilliant beginning to this game. We can watch this fight one more time. Now this flash for the stun from core was a little bit surprising to me You know looking for that dazzle stun because yawn isn't really in position to follow up quick comes in with the ulti They try to just kind of zone him out, but then look at that kind of miscoordination there. Aayla is flashing over the Taliyah ult to try to get the combo on Yawn, but Quidd is going for someone else. He's not ready for that. He's not going for the flip in for that side mixture. They have to be on point with this then when sniper arrives He doesn't even have his ulti he used it down in bot lane when he was scrapping with impact So these core cooldowns that you're dependent upon As his burst composition are missing and the coordination the communication was not there You know a lane quid of two different minds in that fight had gone been flipped in off that Combo from Ayla. Yeah, it could look completely different Yeah, I'm being unchecked in this fight We talked about it in the draft phase that you have to look at this Kalista to being the most consistent damage dealer. If he's gone, if he's taken out early on, then it's an easier win for 100 Thieves. But the fact that Yawn remains alive, now puts more bonus and agency 400 these like really execute these combos together yeah you have to be perfect from this position especially because you know yawn if he realizes the only way that they can actually lose is him getting 100-0. He can just go shield bow next. He can start going really kind of more tanky, defensive itemization. Doesn't have to necessarily maximize DPS. Because everyone over on the 100-0. side is pretty squishy. You don't need a super high damage build to deal with any of those teammates. So, I do think you can start to look to go pretty tanky. You know, just make sure you're not getting 100-0, look for those sorts of plays. We could see things like Knight's Vow coming out from Core, we could see things like Locket coming out from Core. You know, just build towards making sure they can't walk in. one-shot Yawn and TL I think are gonna be in a pretty good spot so 100 Thieves are gonna have to make sure they are absolutely on point in these next couple fights when it does happen they've got to be crisp with the engage they've got to be on point. Gotta make sure that they're communicating ahead of time to know when someone's gonna go in. You know, Ayla has to be saying, I'm gonna be looking for you on this next flash. Hold your seismic shove. Yep. Almost 20 minutes into the game gold lead look at an advantage for team liquid by 3,000 looking for yawn Oh, we tried to perfectly cleanse it not quite So the route is enough time for River to get in range and look for the ceasefire Yone just might be in trouble here, still at the plat, waiting until the very end of the cosmic radius. It's going to keep him alive! Aayla tries to hook him in! They finally take out Yone! And this might be one from HunterTZ at the end of the day. At this point, it's now up to APA to see if he has the damage to be able to last a little longer, but Quidd already falls! What can APA do here? He's being kept back by Sniper as he is marking him and preventing any... Warm damage from Team Liquid to come on in. River now isolating CoreJJ, doesn't hit the Q, but Aayla's there to follow up with a knockup and CoreJJ will fall. Yeah, and the question is, do they go for any? Anything more here with this do they try to push for the tier one top doesn't look like it just yet They are just gonna be taking the scuttle Reclaiming submission we can watch this one more time as Yon stepping forward Looking for an angle for the 1v1 here against Meech, but he gets slowed up by the Hail of Arrows. Slightly early on the cleanse, honestly didn't make much of a difference. I think that River's gonna get in range regardless here with the ulti. But then you can see the Bastion shield with the W flashes forward gets the Q heal as well from the Taric It does come down. That has got to be like 10 HP or 45 HP is what I see They're in the bottom left, but at the end of the day Ayla headbutts it back into the team Meech gets a shutdown, Sniper is there with the ulti. They have the cooldowns, you know Quinn getting locked up By that ulti from Umti was really well placed, they do get a kill back on the other side but at the end of the day they're just too light on the damage, it was only APA to really be able to put out any pressure. And he wasn't gonna be able to do it at this point in the game And you can just see we've already talked about it before but this fight the state of this game has been so hinged on Whether Yawn is alive or not at the beginning of the fight, as Impact might be picked off here. Already popped a ghost, trying to speed on out. Maybe he gets out. of this one wow he is a tanky boy so impact is gonna survive this one but that is down a summoner spell now in the next couple of minutes actually under a minute Dragon will be spawning and not having that cooldown. Maybe it doesn't hurt Team Liquid at the most but it's going to make him less mobile. Yeah it is definitely you know impactful in some of these fights. At the same time, they did get Meech's ult out. You know, had he died right before Baron or right by Baron, maybe they'd go, but Aayla in trouble. Aayla, right onto Yawn, but the Cosmic Radiance is there to guarantee no burst will come through. Umti is front-loading. all the damage as well, stunning up Quidd, meanwhile they find Yawn onto the backline but there's no damage to follow up, Yawn is still alive, Ailen's trying to keep him busy, but EAPA is winning the fight for Team Liquid while Yawn is being kept busy! Sniper wins one on the impact and umpteen river now still alive barely bling on HP This one not really going convincingly to either side. I mean it looked like it was gonna heavily to TL but that seismic shove from Quinn gets them two kills there catching both MT and Impact and now they're gonna try to go for Baron yeah starting it up on the other side as TL actually make the move. They're starting to move, but it's very late. They're going to leave Yawn to finish off the Dragon. Oh, and the Sniper dies to the Baron! River is also super low. He might die to the Baron too, no! River's gonna, on this lead, stun, smite, the shield, the healing isn't gonna be enough, one more auto, they get it, it's a heist baby! And 100 Thieves are out of there. Oh my god, I thought- They were gonna have to bail out for sure, but they had good enough vision Spotting APA the APA could not get there in time to punish. They do lose sniper to the neutral and TL are able a dragon on the other side. So they're gonna be one off Seoul on Seoul point now, but it's a good risky move here from 100 D's to be able to get something back. And let's watch this one more time again. about can you coordinate on the initial play. Flash forward there from Ayla but there's no seismic shove available because UmTi is marking Quinn. Really good tank play here from UmTi. You know recognizing it's not the threat of the engage after mark. It's the threat of the follow-up after a mark So he goes forward he gets the ulti down on quit Quinn can't lay land that seismic shove that one's on him this one he does nail which was really a bailout because TL look at their health they were crushing this fight they would not have been able to get that Baron without that beautiful seismic shove gets them two kills They go to top side they do lose sniper But they get the baron and they keep themselves very close in this game as far as gold Obviously if you go over ocean soul to a sejuani tear it as well as that Cassante you're probably gonna lose the game but at least they have an opportunity here to look at those fights. Ayla might be caught here no flash available there's the Sun from the permafrost into the glacier Prison. Aayla using the ultimate to damage. River coming over the wall. Quinn, can he find the seismic shove onto the priority targets? On the core, JJ. That's not really ideal. River is going to be falling for that one. Impact making sure the sniper can't get into the fight either all out still available But not needing it as he's gonna be able to kite this one out team liquid taking me away the advantage that they already took out River on four strong in the map I mean river is just way too far behind to be any sort of a solo threat onto Jan so there he finds the cue on beyond but there's an immediate lock at an immediate W Shield there from the Taric as well plus the heal comes through They're never gonna be able to 100-0 this guy before the ultimate comes down So he has to use the ultimate actually to retreat to try to get back over the Taliyah wall to try to get out of there, but there was no ability to really follow up and if they can't threaten Yawn, they clearly cannot win these fights, we've seen it time and time again. You know, Quint had a pretty good angle over the wall looking for that seismic shove but it was still into that Taric ultimate so nothing really came of it and TL are gonna be able to win another fight as CoreJJ passes it special for 9th most assists All time special definitely one of the early legendary players in the LCS in his days with TSM remembered very fondly by many and even For a brief time to on Team Liquid and came over when they were still cursed and then rebranded over to Team Liquid a shout Out to Alex Chu as Team Liquid Gonna be posing up here right to see what waves they can catch and see if they can look for another pick here. Aayla still doesn't have flash and he was an easier target for them to get last time and that baited 100 Thieves into a kill. that fight every single time team liquid have been playing so well around the cosmic radiance timing is impact ghosting in looking for and engage was ready to go for me for that all out but a there just making sure that he is marked and impact does not find the pick and back knows there's no point in going for anything too risky the game really is going in their favor so you don't need to roll the dice on something like that, right? You know, take only the high percentage plays. You can see MT, this is pretty questionable, I'm not gonna lie, MT, going for a. cut here. Oh, the executioner is calling. The executioner is Sejuani. It's a little bit sus, I'm not gonna lie. I mean the W does physical damage so it's like It's not the worst thing. Impact, though, might be in trouble! The all-out brings it right back with the Infernal Chains! That's a pick for 100 Thieves, and they're gonna barrel down mid lane. Yep. We'll see Empty on the side here poking away. It's a great pick You can see Hunter Thieves pushing up top lane with the Taliyah pushing in mid lane after that kill on Impact. Impact Feeling a little bit too confident sitting alone against four under that tower. Yes, you are tanky, but you are not that tanky. You're not really ahead in gold. In fact, they are now down a couple thousand gold after these couple of towers did fall. 400 Thieves. So it's going to be all about the setup here, trying to prepare themselves for this big fight potentially. You look on the minimap, look at all these wards littered in this. entire area, TL trying to dominate Vision in that section of the map, really making sure that they are the ones who are going to have all this info around this next Dragonflight. to be coming up here pretty soon and we'll see if they can dominate that area because they get ocean soul they probably just straight up win the game and hundred thieves are gonna have to try to reclaim vision Shout out to the observers showing that it's pure darkness for the side of hundred series walking in Could just be face. They have to wait for quit. They can't just walk up because even if it's someone tanky doesn't get one shot You need your whole team there to follow up so they're waiting for quid coming out of base They saw apa bot lane So now I think they're going to feel confident to push through mid Then walk down to the river and try to reclaim vision that way You can see it impact is trying to hold that mid lane wave But if he's shown there again, you can try to walk in with this five man squad. Yeah, and you have the number advantage for the You just have to wait on impact to be able to collect that wave Let's see here. Ayla can get engaged on by um T first seismic show catches core river trying to front load and mark Impact on the other side, Yone and APA separated from the rest of the front line So not much damage is being traded right on back, Quidd maintaining this posture aggressively as UmTi tries to get back into the spin Mana Brush, Impact walking back on over as the dragon stacking has begun with these red stacks from Yawn. Impact trying to see if he can get an all-quid, Weaver's Wall comes in to yawn. too late as you called it Azalea and they already used the glacial prison as defensively but here comes sniper trying to look for a flank but art of war dictates flank on the weakest side of the flank here cosmic rain is going to be popped up as yon can now dash aggressively in. Meanwhile, they're trying to turn on back, but Sniper's gonna be waiting in the wings as well, but Jahn turns right on back once again, but they've already lost umpteen in the fight. Team Liquid just have to pick to a side. They cannot be just getting pulled apart in both of these sides as 100 Thieves have now marked them for death. River might go down to impact. It's one back over to Team Liquid. with the flash, finds APA, Aayla disengaging and being able to find APA as well on the back end of it as well, 100 Thieves take a fight in their their own. Yeah, Kuwait is going to be able to find a big pick there on APA, they get both the carries. They were too slow on the engage here, they were trying to buy so much time. They were waiting for Sniper who was coming. coming around from below the fight, but it was very difficult to fight past the Orianna ball. We see the snipers trying to come in from the bot side, but it's all about Orianna zoning people out on the other. side. Once APA moves back into this kind of area, you can see everyone from under Thieves able to pile forward. Aile is stepping up, Meech is stepping up, Quidd is stepping up. They no longer have that zone control. And then this flash in so good from Ayla catches out Yone. They burst them down They know they need to get more they gave up ocean soul, which is massive and that ocean soul Regen paying dividends for him back already, but then this flash forward from quid It'd be a trying to sidestep it can't quite get it earns them another kill so they still have a chance in this game but they know it is going to be really difficult from this point. Three tank items completed there for Impact on the top side two-and-a-half done for us. Umti and CoreJJ there as well, you know, gonna be getting tankier and tankier. It's gonna be so difficult to actually punch through not only the initial kind of damage that they have to get out. but now the Ocean Soul regen, if you don't kill off Yawn right off the bat, he can heal up a fair amount in that Ocean Soul during the Taric ultimate. That's extra regen, that is all more health you're gonna have to be taking. dealing with and he has the wits end now so he has the additional resistances from there with that BF very likely could just be a BT last you know really just trying to make sure he's staying alive 100 Thieves, a huge obstacle that they have to overcome against Ocean Soul Team Liquid. They are ahead in gold, yes, but as you already pointed out, Yawn is going to be so tough to kill. the raid boss but quid this guy has leveled up so much since his first split in the LCS last summer so much more confidence from this guy has he is flashing aggressively in these fights he doesn't have flash up for this next potential fight but if there is magic that can be made it will be from this guy's hands absolutely he does have amarello so they do have some sort of heel cut at the very least. Morello's obviously a pretty cheap buy now, so you can kind of tech into that more easily. But that really is their only heel cut right now in River. He does get stunned up, but Umti's in trouble. Ayla finds an engage onto Umti. Mech has already done a decent amount of damage. Cosmic Radiance prevents further burst coming in. As Impact marks Sniper. Here comes Ayla, looking for the engage on 8K. There's the flip from Quinn, he finds it once again. Shockwave is gonna delay time, but APA still goes down. Janna's on the left side, Quinn turns tail. They got him! 100 Thieves, they got both of them! The carries, and now Team Liquid are running for the hills, but Impact is pinned against the wall as Quick finds him once again. He surely will take him out. Impact maybe gets out alive. At this point, 100 Thieves still have five members to push down for the Nexus. Yeah, that should be it. 100 Thieves, I think they've done it. The tanks are hard to crack, but they catch APA. They catch on and they burst them down. 100 Thieves in their first match against Team Liquid at the beginning of the season. So many were skeptical that this team would not make much in this season. They said it was a heist in the first week, but 100 Thieves just might show that it's not a heist. It's a promise that this roster will deliver in the Spring Split as River. And the rest of 100 Thieves carry forward this momentum looking for the last Nexus tower They're running out of minions, but they will persevere through a few more auto-attacks will do it 100 Thieves, take the game! 100 Thieves, another win for this team. 2-0 now again. against TL on the split. Starting off week four here with a bang. Both their games are eerily reminiscent of each other. It feels like they start off. strong they dig themselves into a little bit of a hole but then they're able to come back through their playmaking they're staying confident they're staying aggressive and I've got to say what a game from quit yeah I think he was incredible today on the Taliyah. This guy has leveled up massively from last year. We are seeing the promise that people have been talking about with this. sky. And we are seeing the team really step up around him as well. You know, Meech having a great game on the Verus. 7-1 and 8. Only died that one time. 9-2 and 8 for Quinn as well. of the concern around this 100 Thieves roster was, well, who's supposed to be the carry? You have all these young players, we don't really know if they're going to be able to be consistent. We don't know if you can count on them to get it done. when it matters most. But here, they were able to do just that. Catching APA, catching Yon, time and time again. The perfect timing there on that seismic shove as well. We're going to be heading for a break ahead of Shopify Rebellion versus FlyQuest. Let's see how FlyQuest is doing on RU Smart Event. I wasn't sure if you were done drinking, but... Nah, that's cool. Honestly, I felt my throat a little gravely at the end. Get out, get out, get out. Get out, get out, get out. Wait, how did I die? Good, good, good, good, good. That very is kind of strong. some items. We're doing the same thing again. So I'm going to say essentially a build path and you're gonna list as many items that you can think of that build from this specific item. Wow. Okay, they're worth one point each. Oh my god. So, bounty of worlds builds into five different... yeah? Yeah? Yeah. The five items? Yeah. Uh, dream? Dream... Oh, he doesn't even know. He's choking! He's choking! The first one is Bloodsong? Yes, that's one. Dream... Sleepy dreams, good dreams. I don't know if it's Dreamcatcher or Dream Maker, let's go Dream Maker, there we go. Give it to him. Oh, it's lost. Yeah. There's three others. Then we got Zzak Zzak. What's the next part of it?  No, no, no. Can I help him or no? You can't help him until he fails and it bounces back to you, so. Really, don't give me half point for Zack Zack? No. Please. No. Okay. We're gonna toss it to Dig. Celestial Opposition, Solstice Slay, Zaxax, Realmsquake. Oh my god! I'm out of items, I'm out of items! I'm taking down all of them! the new items. I don't know what the names are. I was hoping for some math questions, not league questions. All right, I am going to read you the description of an item and you're gonna tell me what item. this okay okay unique hex charged gained 30 ultimate haste unique overdrive i mean i know which item it is the one that you buy on nocturne What is it like? How is it the name? Hexplates... Something. Your teammates are dying. He gets half a point at least. Hexplates! Hexplates! Hexplates! That's it? Do you know what it is? Experimental Hexplate? Yes. Good job. We get half a point in this. It's rigged. Because we set up Tomo. We told him it's X-Player. All right, unique light shield strike. Your next basic attack. Cycle sword. No. Thunder in the sky. Yes. Yes! Nice! He's too good. He's too good. He's too good. He's too good. Boost your goal! I gripped really hard. I gripped really hard. Colossal!  all consumption. While wi an enemy champion generat 30 per target second cool down. Hot still? Yes.  I didn't even know it did half that stuff. That wraps up round two. Now we're going to go to a break. You ready? I don't know. I think so. Yeah, you know, just remember, stay in your lane, keep your vision up at all times. You know, time is going to be everything here, so you don't want to miss it. You don't want to go too fast, but you also don't want to be- Hey. I got this. Yeah. I think you do. And Mark, thanks. Hey, no, no, no. Whoa, no. You're not taking my car. My Kia EV9? No way. Don't touch it! Red Bull gives you wings. Thanks for watching! Welcome back to the LCS, I'm here with Sniper after the win against Team Liquid, and I have to ask, you know your first game in the LCS was against Impact. Impact on Team Liquid. You did win, but it felt a little shaky. Here, you got a solo kill against Impact. How did that feel? I mean it felt amazing, because I was like really comfortable on this matchup and I knew I would do good so when I got that solo kill I was like I don't know I just so much I had like so much energy after that you know but then That energy translated into just me dying to a gank, unfortunately. Is this how does the early season compare to your expectations going in from a team perspective? I think I already talked about this but before the split I didn't even think that I was like LCS ready but when scrims started I started like practicing more with my team I got comfortable with the environment and I started improving like drastically you know and from then on it's been it's been amazing That's awesome, and it's a really short regular season, you know? After tomorrow, there's only going to be two more weeks of regular season before playoffs. What are you working on now, because you're still such a... fresh player to the LCS? Just to think ahead and basically just like just constantly think about the game. Sometimes I just autopilot like when I die to that jungle gank so Just being aware of just everything going around me, at all times. You asked me before what I thought of that game, I said it was a banger game, what did you think about that game? What was, other than the solo kill, what were some of the highlights? I was for sure a little disappointed because after I got the solo kill I was up like 20 CS and If I just didn't die to that Sejuani gank the game would like have went on so much more smooth you know so I think other than that the game was pretty good a lot of team fighting yeah last question I noticed during week one you have the shirt tuck yeah still have the shirt tuck Why is that a thing? Bro, this is like, jersey is so big on me by the way. Look at this. I look like I'm like back to school, you know? So like, I don't really want to give up that vibe. I want to be like... Yeah, I love it. It's working for you. Thank you very much. Congratulations on the win. Appreciate it. Thank you guys. Thank you. Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! ♪♪ Aaron would be pretty good too. I agree with you. Welcome back everyone, we got Shopify Rebellion. going up against FlyQuest here. We're gonna be taking on the draft. So first thoughts, anyone? First, first, last. That's a good one. First place, last place. Guys, now there was a question I had for our stats guy. I feel like a lot of times you underestimate the team that's playing on the standing, so he polled post-week stream. history, all LCS history, first place versus last place, including ties, which is this because Shopify was tied for last 1621. Oh, so that's. You know, you do the math, but a little bit below a 75% win rate. That still seems pretty high. It's pretty high. Yeah. shocking to me. Here's why made a bet. I said if he He was going to walk and pike, and then they released a thing with nuke duck, yeah. Here we go. Well, is he going to pick it? Again, hope you guys are excited to spike. funny after talking to Nick Duck in the coaches interview last week where he was like yeah sometimes you just ask your players if they can play something and then you figure out if they can actually play it.  essentially. I think Buccio in general in terms of him widening his fan pool, we kind of talked crazy about how he was going to do it. but he has been a big difference maker in this FlyQuest bot lane and it's been really really fun to see him kind of unleash the Scarlet Flames. It's interesting, you're talking about FlyQuest, I mean at least the champion pool a little bit. I think we can actually talk about the mid lane champion pool for both of these, because to me, that's the most interesting thing between... Jensen going up against Insanity, because it's a pretty wide difference for what they actually play. I mean, they both play Corky. There's the Oriana, switching it up. So we got the Oriana. Wait a minute. So we got the Oriana for Insanity. Turtle, explain what's happening. Well, we just decided to be a little bit more traditional now. You know, we don't want to do that crazy with the Garens. I thought if we played normal stuff we might actually have a chance to win. This is actually, this is actually great having you here though because you were on stage for the first two games. of the split with Shopify Rebellion. What's the vibe like from Shopify and Champ Select? Like, who is driving? It's kind of like a group effort at the moment and Sam kind of lets us like he puts like fuel to our fire sometimes like if we Suggest something crazy. He'll just let us do it. Sam is Revan. Yeah. Yeah All right, Revan, our coach, Revan. I saw FlyQuest hovering that Kai'Sa a little bit. Kind of got me worried because I want the Kai'Sa on my team. well let's see if we get it back let's let's see if we get it back oh my god actually earlier I want the Kaisa earlier we showed a clip in which mossy was cruise smolders so like seems like that's a pick that they've really clung on to and I mean they've seen the earlier games Tomo ran a little bit of a shop in some of these team fights he was He was a terror, so being able to see another smoldering game is gonna be fun. Oh, Zyra's pretty solid, too. He gets the Vi. Zyra-Khan swapped it up last second. standard. Our comp's pretty good so far. Yeah, that's what I was going to say. I was like, this isn't a standard comp. I think I see you guys run. I started trying to win now. Maybe. One of the training weights. So maybe I can't decide whether it's like that or you're trolling me and somehow the Ori is going like top or something. No, they got Orianna time. Orianna's going mood. Okay, so Turtle, what's the matchup like with Smolder versus Xayah? I just think it's like a farming lane and then you have the Rakan being able to threaten. the smolders so I think it should be pretty favorite to Zyrakon now, now that Krakenslayer is like extremely buffed. Speaking of just threatening a pick we're gonna got the Azir locked in, which is the idea, I'm sure, alongside Vice to just threaten Orianna mid, so it's not gonna be that safe. Also, just like Azir versus the short ranges. That being said, I'm reminded of a tweet that Jensen put out where he said that Ori and Azir until it's banned, or Azir was not banned, Ori was picked, so there it is. There you go. Got a classic matchup in mid. And you see... They're not cowards. They did it. Yeah, FlyQuest taking out the Nocturne we've seen. a variety of Orianna Nocturne combos, some successfully, some not as successful, and taking out Gwipo's Olaf from the shop try ability. inside Turtle. When you guys are looking at a team like FlyQuest, because obviously people have to prepare for stuff that Insanity is going to throw in the mid lane, but when you're looking at FlyQuest, do you consider like... Bwipo's top lane shampoo because he's willing to slam a lot of unique picks there. Yeah, we're always a little worried about giving him the counter pick, but I think in this case We're always hoping to get the Uzi. We did we did not get that so I wonder what Faker is gonna do. I'm guessing he's gonna go for the Aatrox He is an insane Aatrox player. Yeah, I think like us, we'll probably pick the Renata on the four. I actually don't know what pair is very well smoldered. Yeah, you were trying to figure that out earlier. It's still because it's such a new champion. Yeah, I think it will be Renata on 4, just because I think it's a good champion. It's a support matchup for Kha'Zix, which is Renata more so in the AD carry position. pairing make a lot of sense and I think Buzio is also a not a player I mean or Pike. Pike is not very good here but I hope you fix it. I was gonna say I hope I hope he picks it. I mean if you're gonna pick a hook champ, this is kind of pike. Oh, I mean, it's long it a little shocked expect that. So what's your thought on this bot lane matchup? He should have just picked Pyke at this point. I don't know why he's going for the Blitz. It's like ruining it for all the fans out there. Wukong also brother Zeyzal. Look at that beard. Oh my god. Wow. They can't hear us, can they? They can't. Okay. Respect. Although, I could tell you that they don't, and then I'd wonder what you said. Oh, okay. Yeah. I just said no. And then I was...  The Wukong, boogie Wukong. This is the first time we've seen it actually. It got a couple buffs, I don't know if it's good. Yeah, I'm still not a fan of the champion, but let's just see. I think those buffs were more targeted. at his laning right? It was meant to buff lane more but he's always been such a good jungler so yeah I expect the Aatrox to be picked. Pick Illaoi you coward. I feel like there's a trend with people holding up posters calling people cowards to pick a champion. It's working pretty well. It is working. Honestly, true. There's the Aatrox that you expected. and honestly Shopify's composition as a whole is pretty solid, it's pretty solid, very standard. It's cohesive. It made sense. We got Orianna. Pulled it all together. There's a lot of threats from the side of Black Quest. At least with Blitzcrank, Vi, I mean a lot of single targets. So Xayah has to be concerned. That's gonna be a Cassante being locked in so thoughts so far on the compositions Which ones you guys favor? I like blue side I just have unknown reasons of why I might say that. Okay, well, we got that out of the way. We're handing this to the casters, but I've heard that... Brazil has a score to settle with Buzio. Yep, absolutely. I mean, here's the thing. You know, Buzio tweeted out, he said he was going to play Pike. I retweeted it, you know, we helped them get the followers, getting a thousand followers. But you know what? When you break trusts, there has to be a reckoning here, Bootsy. Oh no. It's coming, Bootsy. I told you, if you lied, if you bamboozled, I'm unfollowing! Alan, I fear you have made a terrible mistake, losing the a zale follow that is like losing social credit at the highest possible. He can earn it back though with a good blitzking. Okay, okay. Because blitz is pretty hype. Yeah. If he picked like a Lulu. That's like a block, you know, that's the next step. Blitz earned him only an unfollow because he lied to me. He lied to me with something cool, so we'll give him a pass. I don't know. Lying is still pretty bad, isn't it? That's true, that's why he got unfollowed. Alright. Like I said, if it was Lulu, he would have got blocked. Alright, you hear that, Alan? You gotta earn that trust back from Mr. Izzale, the little world champion himself. Yeah, I'm I'm excited for this game really happy to get to cast a smolder game. I've been playing a lot of smolder I actually think that the build that we saw earlier I think is a much inferior build to what is actually, you know, what I think is going to become the meta is a much more tanky, smaller build. I think Shojin Rush into Riftmaker Liandry's is. is so ridiculously strong. This champion's range is too short to consistently stand an auto attack. So you don't actually get a ton of value out of really high attack speed. That build with. Shogun Rush gives you so much CDR early both of the components and with the item completion that allows you to get stacks really really fast and then you're building three straight HP items which allows allows you to really be pretty tanky in these fights. You turn on line a lot earlier compared to the crit build as well, which allows you to have a lot more kind of activity in these early fights, because smolder actually. Scales by fighting it is not like you know on azir or or kale or whatever where you're like, okay? I just got to get xp and get minions and you know the way you get sex faster by hitting people with your abilities. And the way you can actually set yourself up for that is by having a really strong early build and that build lets you get there. It also allows you to tech. into a lot of different angles, you know, for your fourth item, if you're just having a good game, you're not really threatened, you can go rap fire, you can go BT, you can go damage, whatever. But, you know, if it's heavy physical and you're under threat. you're getting dove, you can go Iceborn. If it's heavy magic and you're getting poked out, you can go Kaynek. Like this champion can become a brick wall where you're having 4,000 HP, but as long as you get your stacks you're still killing everyone it is so powerful and I'm a hundred percent convinced it is by far the superior build so I'm really gonna be interested to see if Masu does go for that style or if it is more what I think was he kind of like an initial jump that everyone did which is basically just building them like Ezreal yeah I'm I hope chat was taking all those notes down because I'm pretty sure sure I saw your head expanding literally as you're just like dropping truth bombs all over about this other build for smolder we're gonna see though if Masu actually Ops into that or if he goes for the crit focus build that we saw Tomo play I know the very first competitive game of smolder credit to lady sports and messages from the challengers league also ran a crit build as well I mean it still does damage late game but I think that's an argument worth having it's like having more durability Protects you while you're getting those stacks up. Yeah, and it's not like the crit build is just straight bad Like you will do higher DPS if you're able to auto attack, but the reality is in almost no games I've watched from older and I've both played and watched a lot of it can you actually stand there and just auto attack it almost never happens the range is very very short there is crit scaling on the east so some people do kind of make that argument but I just it's so irrelevant compared to the synergy that Liandry's and Rift has with the flat damage amp you're going to get. How tanky it makes you, how early you can get involved in these fights. to be a comet smolder here he's playing ghost flash so we're going to see w level one pretty much guaranteed and i'm curious to see how many points he's going into it most of the pros i know are kind of of a mind that you go three points W into Q max. I have seen when people are going more the build that I'm talking about, sometimes people will go five points W, and it becomes really powerful both for wave clear and for a lot of these. and the range on it is very high if you're getting multi-man W's, you know, with that early 5 points. It is significant damage, so, uh, there's a lot to learn with this champion. Doran's Ring, definitely the correct start. a lot of people were kind of getting baited by going D blade and it is significantly worse You do need the additional mana the AP pretty nice as well. So it's gonna be a fun one to watch Also in the game we saw earlier the smolder stacks actually came online very late, you know generally We'll see if it is gonna be slower on average in pro because again, it's like even with perfect farm You really accelerate your stacks by fighting right so if there's less fighting in pro Maybe the stacks will be slower on average than in solo queue the best I personally will only get it is around 17 18 minutes Most of my games I feel like you're going to get it maybe around 22 or something, but I'm not doing it perfectly by any means. I have heard of a game where... I think it was nemesis apparently got it in 14 15 minutes That's the fastest I've heard of that is so if you're able to like stack perfectly There's also a lot of little tricks you can do again. I don't know if people are really gonna let you do them but you can stack up Void mites with your Q, you can stack off the mini Raptors, off the mini Krugs, like you can start to one shot all those pretty quick and you can get a ton of extra Stacks if your jungler is willing to donate those over to right so as we pull up our Kia multilane I want to remind everyone while we're on the live patch and you know shout out to our commission mark Z for letting us play on the live fast first before any other major region champions when they are enabled are still the same for every region which is two weeks that is a global rule so there already been scrims and practice with Smolder in these past two weeks. So we're gonna see how much FlyQuest have really rehearsed coming into their first game of Smolder. Exactly, and also, you know, on the inverse side, how well Choppy can punish. Someone else I really want to talk about is Insanity, because he has just been doing such an interesting thing this split. You know bringing out you know very unique picks He has played all kinds of different champions and a bunch of them are actually ones that really only he is playing You know if you're not watching League of Legends around the world you may not realize both Garen and Zac he's the only one in the entire world in this season not even just major regions of any Pro League including URLs etc that has played these picks mid lane. There's also the Sion, he is two out of the total four picks globally, as well in any league, again, to play it. So he is playing some. very atypical stuff and it's been a lot of fun to watch as Lucio tries to time his hook with the midi dematerializer but I think he did a little bit early. I like the thought process. You wouldn't have a problem if you picked Pyke, buddy, would ya? I think it was still the timing of the, I guess, the minion dmg materializer, but you know what, I sympathize with your plight here. Boogie true anybody still have that problem. Maybe maybe maybe now boogie was in the area But not a lot of diving power with wukong early on you bring a lot of damage, but no real CC so just making sure that no one is in the area and just providing some defensive coverage in case Inspired ever off of the reset that he's about to go for comes Zac bot lane but Jensen's very low. And Boogie, once again, not a lot of diving power on Wukong. If you ever see that, then you have to know that it has to be for a guaranteed kill. And Jensen is still safe in this position. doing very well though in this 1v1 you know really has been pressuring Jensen in these early levels. Wukong they touched on it at the desk did get buffs on this batch nice double W there does connect, and that's two stacks. Knock-up from Bucio as he kites on back to protect Masu, making sure that they're not in the flash hook, and B-Boy, at the very last frame, gets out. He's going to be able to flash out of there. Jensen, really getting lit here. Oh my goodness. The pressure just kind of nonstop there from Zeyzal going to be able to stop Fabucio on that recall. You can see Masu, they want it to reset and Masu is still going to reset, but this means the wave is going to crash unless Inspire can come hold it. At the very least he's going to lose some of these minions, but we'll see, can they get B-Boy who has no flash? Yeah, no flash. He might pop the ghost, but they knock up into the queue as guarantees the damage But b-boy does enough damage with Zayzel they get first blood and now inspired is forced to flash Don't tell me he gets out the goes, kiting this one out, Inspires waiting for the Q, Zeyzal flashes in front to block it! That's teamwork right there. That is a really smart flash from Zeyzal if he does not go for that. Inspired might have been able to finish him off, but they try to go for the big play here They try to look to punish b-boy even without Masu there. They can't do it. He walks out they give up first blood, critical though for them, it went to Zayzal, so you are really happy that at least the first blood went over to Zayzal, but it's a 1.2k gold lead, 1.3k. briefly as it jumped up there. Only five and a half minutes in. That is actually a ridiculous lead this early on. That is telling you you're winning in farm. You also have that kill gold. So really. really big. I can see Dark Seal here for Masu for a little bit more early laning power. It does have the long sword, so we'll have to see where he's going to go. A long sword obviously not telling us a lot. It does build into a ton of different items. It could be Shojin, could still be Essence Reaver Yeah, but I'm very curious to see where he's gonna take us and check out on his build. Let's see what he's doing so far He is just the two points W as expected the very least he's gonna go three, and I kind of want to see if he goes Beyond that after after he gets all the stuff. Yeah And guys, this snot bubble is gonna deal a decent amount of damage later into the laning phase as you already see a little bit of that power with the achoo as, once again, the replay. They try to look for the damage, but it's just just not enough once it's fired comes back And just really pristine flash here from b-boy. Yeah, nice flash does react to it And this is post inspired flashing after him the queue is here just in time, but days old flashes in front support dip blocks it up and And Jensen going to be forced to actually shuffle him away as he looks for the sombrero there. Trying to connect on him with the ult, he couldn't quite find it. That would have been crazy. You know, ChefChalet has D.Gone. coined him was looking for a creative angle there but now that is Jensen's flash gone so the next time boogie pays a visit and he's going to be level 6 soon that's an E easy Cyclone follow-up to make. Yeah, yeah, you can hit him with that Cyclone, you know, try to get in there, look for that gank set up. Obviously, you know, being able to go into the clone, you W in with the Orianna ball. on you and the nimbus strike for the shockwave come through it is a really nice little point of initiation especially if you're coming out of a brush they don't see you approaching that can be very surprising and is that powerful engage they could be looking for is nice little flap flap there from Masu yes out to the side that that fly is is a big injection of speed but it lasts very little times you kind of have to be on point with it but you know as we see a showcase there Masu has the reaction time to be able to step out of it Oh, Bucio might be in trouble here no flash and there's the cyclone from Boogie as he gets ready to throw down the staff, and Zayzal picks up another kill. Share the love Zeyzal two kills on the Rakan is the only two kills so far in this game the W to prep the wave He's gonna look to try to last hit all of these with the Q once you have 25 seconds Facts again, it becomes AoE, becomes very easy to just do W into Q on the backline and one-shot that. And remember, any minion that does get last hit, it's not just the one that you shoot your Q at. Uh, so if you have AoE... You get a multiple minions, you get multiple stacks with the Q, so it's something to remember. You really do have to focus on stacking if you guys want to play this champion at home. And trust me, even if... You know pros are playing the crit build. It's definitely a lot easier to play the HP based build because it's a lot more forgiving for your positioning. Yeah, building durability gives you a little bit more breathing room and larger range. room for error as FlyQuest trying to prep this dragon but Boogie, Insanity, and Zayzal are also here. 2k on the HP, Lucio with the hook finds Zayzal, the Achu gets a Decent amount of damage, but Zayzal's not in any threat, just dances over the wall. And Red Team, aka FlyQuest, are able to pick up the dragon. Yep, gonna be able to grab that. Nice little bit of poke back. as well, 49 stacks now for Masu. So, at a crazy pace. Of course, it does accelerate as you get further into the game. This is gonna be that Sheen buy, so it likely will be the- since reverse and unfortunately I really want to see the other build I'll try to be a build salesman you know I've got to go talk to some pros convince them yeah I was trying to sell tactical on it earlier but He seemed intrigued. I won't say he was sold. Well, he definitely witnessed the power of Smolder firsthand in the second game of the day. Mom! Mom! They're pushing my tower. Clear the way, please. As FlyQuest, gonna be able to make sure that no more plates go to the side of Shopify. If Matsu might be in trouble, decent knock-up, but it's. More damage done to Zayasul than it is done to Masu here. Yep, not too big of a deal, just use the ulti to clear that out. He is in fact going 3 points W into Q max, that's basically what we always are seeing. with the Essence Reaver build these days so he's gonna be going that kind of more common crit build. Inspired obviously just clearing away here on the top side has been focusing on the camps. A little bit ahead of the farm as a result, but Insanity here may be getting caught out. about how he approaches the river here and sanity trying to set up an offensive position in case he does first grub has already been taken by boogie and inspired Has flash available. Bvoy is here as well though, and Smolder is way behind on the rotation, so this should be Shopify's. Don't think they're gonna be able to contest on the FlyQuest side. And there's no dragon to take as they. already took it just a couple minutes ago so full grubs controlled by Shopify Rebellion but boost is going to take this opportunity to set up some aggressive vision in this red side Jungle and Zayzal knows he know that they saw them dip into the fog of war so now Zayzal People we have to be careful play through the mid wave the shockwave is gonna connect on the Jensen I don't think he has flash quite yet he has to shift on over and he gets out alive yeah gonna be okay of course there's not a lot of AP behind that shockwave it's a tear and an amp tone plus the Doran's ring so Lucio Nice attempt there, tried to time it out. Obviously they have that ward up above. As Masu just looking for some W poke here, trying to get that WQ, again getting as many stacks. as possible every opportunity that he has and you can see you know it's it's not as weak of a laner as people think you know in the initial days people were all doing Q max and they're talking well this You can't even lane it's terrible, and how are you supposed to get to those stacks? But they're actually doing quite well in this 2v2 you know he is 15 CS ahead in fact. They're stacking reasonably well Again, we'll have to kind of get a better barometer for like what a good rate of stacking is in pro because it is just a lot less scrappy than when you're playing solo queue and you're just having all these fights non-stop where you can get a ton of stacks. Yeah, because if you have a long extended fight where you're just queuing someone on cooldown and hitting multiple people with your W You can walk out of a fight with like 20 stacks. No problem. True. I still can't get over the fact that This is something that I haven't actually watched the game, this is what someone told me, so maybe this is totally fake news, but I'm going to try to find the bot. I mean 225. I want to see what the fastest possible is. Yeah, because we're about 12 minutes and Masu has gotten about just under 75 So he still has about three more iterations of this so if we're going at this same pace it would take until about what 33 36 minutes to get there but obviously maybe if there's more scrapping towards the mid game he can accelerate that And it does speed up as you get more items, because your cooldowns get lower. So it's like early on in the game, you're not getting every single last hit with your Q. It's just not going to happen, because you need to be able to actually push the wave and so on. As you get later on in the game you do literally get like every last hit with your Q So it does accelerate But I do think you know even even if you're not getting it by like 22 minutes at least for the game I've played that is pretty slow, and I think 22 minutes is nowhere close to optimize I do know that some other players that I've talked to are saying in their solo queue games They're able to get it you know sub 20 Basically like very consistently, so it'll be interesting to see you know how that does kind of work itself out in pro Like I says this game all there is first we will have more wins than loses You're not wrong. Yeah That's that's crazy. You know that just adds more to you know late-game scaling narrative for NA in general, but FlyQuest seem to be preparing for this next dragon as Shopify Rebellion are the first ones in the river. Zeyzal marking, making sure that he's scoping out vision here and clearing out these wards that FlyQuest are trying to put down to give them that safe entrance into this objective point. Looks like Bvoy is able to clear out the wave first, he's going to get the chance to reset before... dragon spawns in the next 40 seconds. So, he might be, I don't know if he has enough gold for a first full item, he does. Kraken Slayer online, so B-Boy's gonna be decently strong for this next fight. Yeah, he's going to be looking pretty strong up in top lane. You can see Bwipo just went straight towards that Thornmail rush here, you know, didn't stop for Tabi's. I don't really love the full Thornmail complete. You know as a first item. I just think in general he'll cut early on especially Against the trucks if you're not gonna kill threat anyways super overrated I'm really just kind of a fan in general of these builds where you just go Bami and then you go into Frozen Heart or Kaynic, depending on if you're laning against physical damage or MR, and then you just build the other. I just think that build is so strong, but you should talk to Bobo because he is someone who really is very opinionated about the builds and does think kind of deeply about them you know maybe the logic here is that he can just kind of force trades and take a lot more scraps that are going to be in his favor Shockwave right onto Jensen, the Cyclone and the knock-ups from Zeyzal, there is no room to breathe on that one, Shopify making a clean execution on Jensen. But Jensen not reacting in time or potentially not thinking he needed to flash But he is gonna be burst down in a hurry. So this dragon should be Shopify's no problem off the pick there Jensen gonna be able to TP when he's up, but the dragon should be gone before then Yeah, I think the only thing that boosts you is playing for maybe an isolated pick here inspire wait teleport is being committed by both top laners. Oh, this is gonna be tricky. Bucio is getting chunked out, looks for the silence, but he gets bursted out by B-Boy. Bwipo's on the other side, on the wrong side of the fight as well. Inspired, getting marked out by Faker. Here's the teleport from Jensen, but Boogie secures it and he gets out over the wall, FlyQuest They don't really have an angle to force another fight unless Blitbo can find a knockup with his Q looking for the third Q right on the b-boy but there is the feather storm as he's able to get out yeah gonna be able to get out Jensen though looking for the angle scoop finds fake off but the angle is not good enough him to really find a kill on there. FlyQuest just really devastatingly not getting anything out of this fight. Yeah, they don't get much whatsoever. They try to kind of force their way in. Anyway, you know clearly did not want to give up that dragon wanted to maintain their dragon stacking here Got the first one trying to look for scraps again You know when you have smolder you want to be taking these fights getting those stacks from it but because Jensen was picked off prior they did not have a good setup whatsoever and unfortunately for them not gonna walk away with anything if it didn't push out the side lanes they didn't really get anything from that I have to wonder if FlyQuest aren't oh no Jensen he has flash available he should be fine Flash away from the QW, but Boogie, oh no. Jensen getting taken out. Man, Shopify Rebellion have really put a focus on Jensen in this game. And he is, he's had an incredible split so far. This is a game where he's really been the focus. Yeah, he absolutely has. And, you know, we can take a look at how Jensen is doing this split versus last cause he's actually been really good for FlyQuest this split. On the left that is Jensen this split on FlyQuest, on the right that is Jensen last split on Dignitas, so really has been stepping up his game and as a result Clearly, Shopify coming in, wanting to put the focus on him, wanting to try to knock him down a peg, and they have gotten Insanity into this good spot. He is definitely in that advantageous position. getting a lot of kills as well. And Wukong, though he's not as strong, I think, when we were seeing it a lot last year, it's definitely a pretty strong pick and it is someone that does really. really well with gold. You can snowball heavily, you can threaten that backline, especially when you have other people that can dive with you, like the Rakan, like the Aatrox, like the assistance of a speed up and a shield. shockwave coming through from the Orianna so you know Boogie in a great spot here to potentially carry this game there are quite a few squishy people on that other side and you're looking at Smolder you're looking at Azir It's one of the best visions at all. With this build, you just get one shot. And then Mugi is gonna be still dealing a ton of damage, even though the Divine Sunder made him so. durable and tanky with all the pseudo sustain you were getting with those empowered Q stacks. The Strive Breaker recently getting buffed on this patch is going to ensure that once Boogie finds someone he's going to stay on top of them with that slow active that you get as well. The fact that Shopify Rebellion are really accelerated in this game against the competition. position that is taking time to really scale on up, means that they have the advantage to try and close this one out before FlyQuest gets to that point. Yeah, both the passive cleave got buffed as well as. The active on that little shockwave there as Masu is just going to be clearing out that wave Oh, but mom is not enough to bail out Masu under the tower as fire is going to be falling next they've got it picking up an easy double and they've got another charge here comes the Herald as it crashes once again Shopify Rebellion seven and zero at 18 minutes against the number one team in the LCS. Man, they are looking so good in this game. They are crushing them. And they've already picked up wins against Cloud9 and NRG. They're picking up wins against all these expected top teams then they'll go and they'll drop games against some of the teams that you're thinking Oh, they should be able to beat these guys. So it is so interesting. They have kind of become the new era CLG, the counter logic gaming here, but what a great Q there from FakeGod interrupting the dash there from Masu when you get Q'd out of the 5-5-flat that is gone The follow-up was there from Zayzal as he flashed forward and they burst down Masu Really making his job difficult, you know He wanted to clear it out with the W with the ult he got everything except the cannon Rift Herald is there too, so they just forced the dive right in on after it, and it looks like it's probably going to be just a rapid fire second here for him. just tangoing with Fake God, but Boogie might be ready to boogie himself, as Blippo still has some reinforcements in stage right, as Bucio's gonna escort him. out of danger there but Shopify Rebellion I just want to circle back to the fact that they are doing so well because all their wins have been against the top teams in the LCS But I think that just reiterates how Maybe you can say whether it doesn't indicate the strength and the competitiveness of our region overall But it's been super entertaining that the fact that there's no free wins that you can get with any single team. Last year I think I barred two teams you would always be like oh well all right the 10th place team is gonna be taken out here but Every single team, you cannot just be at all complacent with them because they will definitely steamroll ahead of you. Absolutely. I mean, we saw the teams coming into this week that were tied at the bottom, you know, Dig, Shopify. Dig already got a win shot by looking like they're in a great position to get a win here as well These teams are very competitive. They have strong players Inspired is he gonna go for it? I think he's too far gone. Yeah, they got already burning the flash But inspires gonna chase him past the tower and he has boost you here isn't enough damage though as he pops the world ender And that might just be enough to dissuade the fight from happening and meanwhile Boogie is on the other side of the map taking a free dragon because FlyQuest are dedicating so many resources just to take out Fake God. Yeah, they're sending three top here. They're gonna be able to get a little chip damage. Oh my god. Now they're gonna TP. It's five top for FlyQuest. They need to make this work. They are all in on this play. Teleport is coming. Coming in from Shopify, will it come in time though? Here it comes, Mom! Fake caught, a lot of damage, but B-Boy comes from the right as he looks to be able to equalize the fight. Fake caught has already fallen, but Bwipo. might be the next one, as B-Boy cannot step up in range. And Sandy gets speared by Jensen on the back half. That's a double over to FlyQuest and a little bit of life. Yeah, that is B. Getting a couple kills, they needed to make this play work here. Truff I try to come in and save him, Bboy in some trouble potentially. Lucio looking for the hook, but he dodges out with his own flow. Sejzal is getting bounced out to the middle of all of them, but Bboy finds one back on a Jensen. Now has to cut this one out against Wippo, but he doesn't have the ultimate anymore. Moss is able to deal the finishing blow. Inside Bwipo, here comes Boogie, Cyclone finds the baby dragon, as now Bwipo is left to scraps, but he's got three more members, oh Buccio, he falls, does Bucci- But Boogie does have enough damage here! Here comes the turn of the work! The fight has lasted so long! Boogie just danced all over them! Boogie goes huge for- Shopify FlyQuest felt like they were getting back into this game but it's Boogie crosses the map after taking the dragon and crushes them on the play FlyQuest They know they're behind. They know they need to make a play. They'd already forced out fake console The mom comes through the initial burst very good. Look at that multi-minute W as well from Wippo setting up the Then the Stasis here from Insanity, but as he steps forward, Jensen finds an angle to knock him down. We've got to look back at live though, as they are on the Baron. This play went on for a long time. It's been a long time as the flash forward from Jensen reacted to there by B-Boy. The mechanics on these players are on point. Buscio in the area, gets Vision, Inspired is running from base. Will it be too late, or are they gonna try to flip this? 2K, Jensen, unless he can get a miracle steal, but the smite is good from Boogie. Shopify Rebellion, 22 minutes into the game 12 and 4 6k gold up Baron at their side if you told me this would be the result coming into this game I would still be surprised but man I have been loving the LCS so far this season man. This is just such an exciting Second game to follow up what the banger we already had in Team Liquid and 100 Thieves and it looks like just keeps on delivering in week four. Yeah, absolutely. We've been getting really cool picks. The teams have been very competitive. Has been a lot of fun. You know, for FlyQuest at this point, you want to say, well, maybe Smolder can bail us out, but. Not even 160 stacks here, 22 minutes in, so Masu's struggling to keep up those stacks and to still be involved in the plays to maximize the stacking, has not really been able to do it. Yes, you do solve these here. You have this molder. So if the game can go really long there is opportunities But again with this build, there's so little room for error. You are so squishy with this build compared to the more tanky versions and there is a really powerful dive there's a five kill Wukong who now has a Sundered Sky plus that Stridebreaker. Insanity you know farming pretty well and he's in a pretty strong spot behind him on those two items so it's gonna be tough for Masu to stay alive even if he can get to the stacks that he so desperately needs will he be able to live in a fight I don't really know And it's just not even two items yet at this point compared to b-boy who's already working on a third So severely behind and I think fly quest took a huge Gamble by having such a heavy scaling composition all eyes were on inspired to really be that bridge But ever since that bot lane outplay from b-boy and Zayzal who? I mean, Boogia has been performing insanely well this game as well, but in every single win from Shopify Rebellion so far, it has always been some type of fumbled attempt to make it to the finals. I mean, Boogia has been performing insanely well this game as well, but in every single win from Shopify Rebellion so far, it has always been some type of fumbled attempt to make  Shut down Bboy and Zezo from the beginning. When you look at the energy game, they tried to go for the dive, they got blasted. When C9 tried to go for the dive, they got blasted. And when FlyQuest tried to- upset them once again, they feel the same fate. that I really think it's just been about solid play here from Shopify Boogie right place right time everywhere he needed to be throughout this game putting on pressure keeping his farm up and he has really Just been such a difference maker here. Masu now does have that rapid fire completed You can see Sterak's through now for inspired as well But the item completion is still not really inspiring a lot of confidence that they can get it done here as everyone on the other side is kind of equal or ahead except for mid lane where Jensen with that death cap now you start to say hey maybe you get that right fight for the Azir and it could happen. Yeah. But we'll see, you know, they do have some X-Factor style champions. They have good engage, they have good pick with potential hooks from Blitz, but Blitz from behind is just such a bad. champion. It is a really difficult to find those angles for hooks. As Yeltsin is getting thrown out time and time again here for wave clear, they're just trying to buy time. They're trying to get these stacks. now for Mastiff, so he is closing in on that benchmark that he needs. There's pings, there's pings for a teleport. This is a long con flank from Bwipo, but who do they want to look for? Zayzal is going to... Pop the quickness, finds the target on Inspired as well. They pull Insanity, can they burst him out? He goes golden with the stasis. Is that enough time? Shockwave onto two, Masa and Jensen! are almost gone! Jensen survives but Masu falls as now the rest of FlyQuest are all depending on Jensen to save this game from ending right here. Yeah, Jensen's in trouble, he's got to run! They look for another one, Jensen still has no HP to work with, almost going down the fake gun, he falls! A straight feather from B-Boy clips him! Shopify Rebellion will find four, and it's just Bucio left. Oh, that hook from Bucio might have actually ended the game. He hooked him in, and unfortunately, it means yes. they get a kill, but Jensen goes down as well. That extra little bit of damage was all they needed. Moss is going to be back up in the fight, but he's got no sums. He instant goes flash when he saw Zayzal ulting. towards him, then had no summs and no E to react to the Shockwave from Insanity. That caught him. He instantaneously dies as FakeGod comes over the top with the Q. It looks like they won't feel confident to try to push for the end here They're gonna continue playing towards these objectives with the base in tatters The inhib down in both bot and top will mean a lot of farming is going to be given over to them. Masu looking like he's going towards Zhonya's third as the itemization I'm guessing there you know with the cloth armor. I mean maybe just to sit on a seeker so that he doesn't get into the blasted, but I mean at that point I Don't I don't know it's it's it's a It's tough, right? Because like I'm saying, this is the weakness of the build, which is why I think, you know, it is... Would it have made a difference in this game? Probably not. So let's just put that out there. But, you know, I do think, you know, you're... were so squishy it's so difficult to actually be in range and auto attacking that is why I just straight up don't like the crit build yeah and we saw like he's recognizing you know what I can't really step up I'm just gonna get one shot He instantly had to use both his thumbs, then he just gets insta-killed by the shockwave plus that Q from FakeGod So I think it is going to be Seekers or full Zhonya's, you know, working towards that just trying to stay alive, hoping that they overcommit. Maybe you can use stasis to immune a shockwave and turn around a fight in that way, but obviously it's tough. It's really tough. Because when you look at the compositions now on both sides, I mean like yeah, FlyQuest have this insane scaling composition And you have really one major form of disengage. That's the Emperor's Divide. Once that's gone There's nothing really strong from the side of FlyQuest that stops B-Boy from brute-forcing into your team. Zeyzal just blitzing right through, FakeGod just charging forward as well. are just so dependent and so limited on how many ways to disengage in this fight it feels near impossible yeah it is really tough right you know range is kind of that weakness he finally has 225 stacks so just before 28 minutes it did hit that mark the question is going to be can he actually effectively use those stacks now can you get spam Q's out without just getting one shot Because who are you supposed to step up and Q in this? If you step forward and try to Q the Aatrox and he EQs you, you're probably dead. If you get caught by the Wukong, you're probably dead. Shockwave, dead. So it is going to be really, really tough. He kind of has to really make sure that he's maximizing his damage while still waiting out those initial engage tools You know, you have to stay close enough that they can fail to engage then you can punish That's the only way they can win And they want to get this TP from Jensen. They're trying to force it. He's still staying bot He's refusing to come in just yet. Oh boogie tries to flank on an inspired I don't think he has flash available. He gets taken out Very early on Masu is the next target. He has the seekers this time for the stasis, but will even fall He has the 225 stacks, but just not enough damage as Jensen is trying to do work on the front line Wipo stalling, but it's just not enough. Shopify Rebellion are taking everything away from FlyQuest. They don't even need the Baron. They have two in open. Inhibitors are going to just brute force their way into the game. Flashing in Jensen tries to punish but the rest of shopper I rebellion rally around b-boy They're newest player as Jensen just gets completely obliterated by B-Boy! Shot by Rebellion are going to do it, taking down Flak West, who are in sole possession of first place. They crush through. The empire of these top teams stand no match for the rebellion of Shopify as they take down, again, another first place. team fun game to watch here nicely done on the engage they start the Baron they look for the turn it is again boogie finds the ulti pops a cyclone flashes in on top of Smolder and as Masu tries to use the fly to get over the wall to flash forward there from Zayzal follows up on it CC him out of that ability locks him down down, burst him down. No way for him to get out of there. They were really on point with the hard engage here. Shopify, you know, people have been cutting, some people on one side are really. loving that they're cooking and doing all these crazy drafts, but there has become a more vocal group that are saying, well, you guys actually just can't play normal. You can't play a standard draft. You're not gonna be able to actually make it work. They kind of are just proving the haters here a little bit coming out with probably their most impressive most solid win of the season Yes, they had already beaten some really top teams, but it was more from punishing their opponents mistakes on these failed dives. This one was just them being proactive, them finding gauges, them coming with a really strong draft that worked from multiple angles, combined well, you know, shutting down. down what Mossu is bringing out here with the smolder, you know, clearly they were prepared for it, they knew how to answer it, and I just think it's a really solid game plan, executed very very well from Shopify. I mean even just straight-up mechanical outplays as well. You could tell that FlyQuest were aware of how how threatening B2B is. and Zeyzal could be if they were ahead which is why they threw the focus down there early on in the game but just simple move maneuvers being able to dodge out on CC abilities and then Zeyzal Flashing forward to block Inspired's Q when he was looking for the cleanup and then even boogying himself I think he was also just a clear standout for me in this game saving what could have been FlyQuest come back back in. Yep. The jersey's looking really nice too. Dude, yeah. I'm liking it. Themed for Lunar New Year today. That's freaking awesome. The red and gold such a... clean color clean on the rift clean on the drip as well as i believe we are ready we're be joining WildTurtle and FateGod on stage for the interview. I thank God. How do you feel after that win? I feel great. It's all expected win as usual. How'd you guys How'd you guys get so good overnight? Oh I think we were always this good. We just we were testing some stuff mid lane a lot so it might have made our team look a little weird, but Yeah, we just picked Orianna and just won, it's that easy. But how do you feel about your coaching staff? You know, like, how does Wild Turtle stack up against Red? Oh yeah, well, Wild Turtle, he's the best coach I've ever had. He's so good, he always talks on everything. It's amazing, it's amazing. That's why we won today, guys. How are you going to keep improving moving forward? We'll just keep doing the same stuff. keep on grinding. I mean we're still like kind of last place so you have to keep winning so it's not over yet you know. Don't say that. It's the truth. Are you expecting to play any secret picks tomorrow? Tomorrow's TL, I'm not sure. We'll see. I usually save the secret pick for our mid laners. I'm trying to bait him, but it's not working. Alright, thank you for the interview, Mr. K God. Thank you, Turtle. Happy New Year. Happy Lunar New Year Welcome Welcome back to round three of Are You Smarter Than LCS Pro. We're done with items. It's a new round. This is gonna be about pros returning or new to the LCS. stage. First question, this pro taught himself English through talking to an AI. It's immortal stop linear, uh, castle. Yes. How do you know that? He's actually a fan. What? I saw, like, Immortals Progressive on Twitter. Oh. You're a big fan. Yeah, I'm a big fan. I follow them. All right. This recent addition to the LCS is named after a soap brand. Dove? Yes. That's my build. That's a f***ing Dove! I didn't think you'd ask questions like that! That's their team! Rigged! Well, there are players from both of your teams in this next question. There are a total of six players who are returning to the LCS stage after some time away from it name all six Whipper inspired Now I have to think of what they're all up for. He's out of time. Returning? Ole? Yup. Zazel? Yes. Uh... Any of you returning?  Depends, like, how much time do they have to spend in the LCS? They could have even, for example, subbed in during playoff games. Did you sub in next year? Maybe. I'm gonna say next year. He did sub in next year. There's one more. Shockfire Rebellion. Who's on that? All right. It's going to Bucio. Do you know? But I can talk to my team, right? Yeah, you can confirm. Thank God. Thank God. Yeah, that would be who it is. Yes.  is the final question. This is the final question? Yep, so you can confer, go around your tables, because you're going to be writing some stuff down. Get someone with good handwriting. It's time for Catch-Up XP. I am going to... give you eight players, y down all of their names a going to put them in orde age, like guess their correct age, you get a point, and you also get one point for putting them in the right position. So you ready? Save the names, yeah. Alright. X you. Wait, can you repeat that?  Okay, yeah, I'm gonna make it true. Bucio, you're also one of them. I know how old I am. Luckily. Sniper. This is a good one. Olleh. I have no idea. That's a good one. Jojo. Contracts, Wild Turtle, and Yawn. You have two minutes, time starts now. What do you think of this ring? This guy's third, I think. How do you guys know this sh**, man? I have no idea. I have no f***ing idea what anyone's age is, like, I couldn't care less. It's fine, we will maybe carry you. You carry me. Yo, how old are you? How old are you? I just turned 23. Actually?  Yesterday my birthday yesterday. Yeah, thank you. He's bathing you are you yeah? Yeah, you'll never like that I would never lie to you. Okay. Nice. Okay. I think we're we've decided Inspired go for it Sniper 17, Dojo 19, Busio 20, John 22, XQ 23, Contrax 25. All at 26, white turtle at 27. Just guess the ages of that. Wait, they can't copy. That's not legal. They didn't write the ages down. This is over. They couldn't follow instructions. I have Cypher, Jojo, Lucio, Xiu, Yawn, Contractz, Olleh, Welter. We just ranked them like youngest to oldest. It took so long. GG. GG. Dig, you got 26 points off that from age order. Our producer said congrats for listening to instructions. W, we take those. All right, so you did better on the this question, but Dig wins. Absolutely right. Absolutely right. Nice. We knew we were doing it right. Thank you both for joining me, thanks for watching. watching, like, comment and subscribe. Thanks to that, Emily. Unfortunately, FlyQuest lost again today and. one. So that was the foretelling of what was going to happen. Let's check out the players of the game from today. First comment cannot be about the roles. What stands out? Wow, Quidd's really improved from last year. Fudge had a nice bounce back for Cloud 9. Boogie with the great Wukong. For me, I am now a Quidd enjoyer. Okay. had a great split so far and it felt like after the last split everyone's been holding their tongues and on top of that everyone's kind of been attributing a lot of success mostly to like working alongside River. I think he's just been standing out and it's been great to see a lot of progression that he's had and the fact that 100th is a double down on him. And I want to call out Boogie because we did talk about how Wukong, we're seeing a lot  We talked more that they were more targeted towards lane Wukong, but he came out with a really good game. And also something I noticed is that he was going into his lanes a lot more which is really when I think he excels a lot as a jungler I'm gonna steal it I'm just gonna go for a second one Tomo smolder That's Pog for picking Smulder. Immediately. He has been slamming that in solo queue since Smulder was released. And it worked out? I was a little afraid when he got cheesed by Ole and he died. with both sums being blown but then he ended up coming out strong in team fights and overall like the tips and tricks that he talked about in the interview as well like he got to be able to showcase the strength of Smulder and now we're getting started see it get picked a little bit more. So yeah, stack them fast. Let's get into the highlights for today to see all those winners. Cloud9 ended their four-game losing streak, a rematch of The summer finals from last split they've actually beaten energy twice now after this Yeah, I think in this game more than the first time they met a lot of it came off of some NRG kind of happy game moments, let's just say, like there were, and we'll see how. energy, uh, regroup because after this, obviously they're now on a little bit of a lost streak. Um, but I think it feels really good for C9 specifically especially since I feel like maybe people won't have as much to say about their draft this time around it was a lot more like ease of execution was there and the team looked pretty well coordinated. They outscaled for sure. Immortals versus Dignitas was looking good. pretty good for Immortals early for me. Castle with another Aatrox game, Hui kind of dumping damage, but Dignitas had a really cool draft. thing. At first, I echoed your sentiment. I also felt like, okay, they completely destroyed Smolder after that second base. It seemed like it was going to be a pretty easy game. For me, it was some of the fights that IMT were stirred and mis-executed. The dragon fights for me were a big one. Actually, this one was just a huge, if I remember correctly. Oh, this was a huey. This was a huey moment and a half. Man, he blew them up. There were a few dragon fights. There were a few dragon fights, but this one was crazy and for me, solidified IMT winning, but that didn't happen. Yeah, I think the big thing for me is IMT should not be fighting without Hui and then DIG were obviously just waiting for Smolder to come online and there was. a fight in the topside where it ended up shifting in Diggs favor and that's kind of when Smulders started taking over. Yeah third game of the day almost had a Tarrick dip. Team Liquid did pick up Seoul during this one, but 100 Thieves, so many just massive Taliyah team fight wins that led to quids. player of the game it was actually pretty crazy this double flick was insane so like that one I immediately I thought Team Liquid is gonna win that fight before that yeah play ended up happening I think this was a forced fight where the Taric ultis were just not hitting yeah so overall the team fights team Liquid found their lead they were starting to solidify and I think just too many fights that were just getting launched yeah I mean this was really cool to see from hundred thieves though like we've been talking a lot about their success and a lot of it is due to the way that they draft around the players they have and the way they understand the players they have. Probably the most lopsided game of the day. Surprisingly. Shopify greater than FlyQuest. Okay. I hated the Blitz pick, by the way. I'm so mad. Should he have picked Pyke? Yes, absolutely. If you're going to do nothing and lose, you may as well do it on Pyke. I just don't understand what the Blitzkrieg was supposed to be doing. Maybe there's a future where this ends up being meta and I can eat my words, but right now I'm gonna say I just hated it. This was a really close five, just specifically, because this one. look like Black West was turning it. The Wukong, who was doing dragon, then went farmed mid, then went topside to actually help out in the play because he realized it was going long enough and then gets a triple kill so like Boogie had an ideal gameplay after that one. What a split so far. It's been a fun time. Yeah. It's been a really fun time. I'm actually, I think I know the standings. Like, I think I could recite them. Yeah? But it's going to be close, because the worst team has three wins. The worst team has three wins, like one game away from 500 to be in last, which means Cloud9 is a game out of last, despite winning today. You can do this every day. You're going to do this every day. Yeah. Immortals is in left. I was like, here it comes. But they're a game out of 30. Seriously, it's just compressing so much. it's crazy. I also want to shout out 100 Thieves. Again, they are solidly in second place, like sole possession of second place, going into tomorrow before we have little break after that and like even even if they lose tomorrow right which they are facing kind of a revamped rejuvenated C9 that makes this match super interesting because i don't think any of us are not i don't think i know none of us expected this hundred thieves team to be looking as good as they have and also be this high in the standings. Dignitas and NRG, Team Liquid Honda, honestly Shopify's hardest matchup. They're not going up against the first place team so let's see how this one goes. Yeah, they're winless against second to eighth. Oh my god, they gotta change it sometime. It's tough, and Immortals versus FlyQuest, no. It was probably the easiest week on paper for FlyQuest. They're like, we're 6-1, we're flying high, we play, you know, last place Shopify and Immortals, easy 2-0, let's go next. Nope, that's not how it works. We have an interesting bunch of teams. I think it's gonna be fun to see how tomorrow goes, but looks like we're looking at the NACL schedule. Watch that right after this. It's on twitch.tv slash LCS underscore challengers. Wildcard versus fly quest challenger. That actually should be a banger. And fearless draft. Lots of unique champions. If you don't know what Fearless Draft is, go over, check it out. It's really cool. That's it for us, though. We'll be back tomorrow at 4 p.m. Eastern, 1 p.m. Pacific. So let's send it over to APA Stream. He's streaming. See you over there. He's driving? He's got a license. to the top, who he's still at about half HP. Fudge coming in, looking to complete the dive, as Berserker goes in to reinvade. Scopeland is thrown back into the team, all out goes Fudge, all in goes Contractz, but he's 1v5'd, he is! He ain't alive, everybody died at C9, three for nothing. There you go. And then that'll cost you. I mean, the game gets, maybe we can get a win here. Wow, she not just back. Do you want to get mid, maybe? Not just back. Nice! We're back. This feels weird. What the? I'm not used to this. Like. Like. Like. Like. Like. Like. Like. Like. Thanks for watching! Smolder, but he ain't gonna find him. Tombo's already killed off two, and now Immortals, where can you even go? A triple kill back to Smolder. Dignitas are ready to march it down mid for the next. Yo This is do not get silos If we even farm it's like not fighting Wow! Sniper! I think can oh, they're going to go go go go go go go go go. Let's go. I'll do it You heal you up. He'll be like 50. He'll be forward. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, yeah I'm getting one-shot by this just do it do it do it do it do it what the heck Despite the shield, the healing isn't going to be enough for Barov, they get it, it's a hype baby! And 100 Thieves are out of it. Good, good, good, good. Very, kinda, stereo Yone is on the left side, wind turns tail, they got him! 100 Thieves, they got both of the carries, and now... Thanks for watching! I'll do the push. I'm tipping. I'm tipping now. Okay, let's keep going. Let's all stop Nice nice Baron where you played really good That timer top was so... She just pressured the map right in front of us. We are first place! KILLER! Good job, good job guys. I'm a sister. Can we kill this guy? I knew we should give. Oh. You can kill him maybe. Can you have ult? Oh. Nice.  Thanks for watching! 🙏🙏 Thank you for watching 🙏🙏 Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! You\""
