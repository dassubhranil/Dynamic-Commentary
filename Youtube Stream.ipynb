      "Translated Transcript:\n",
      "[{'text': \"I was like wow that's pretty strong  especially with some of the strong you  know ideas about the game that that you  have on your team with Jensen and bppo  but it it really seems to be working out  for them they even have Good Vibes like  whippo is hyping up his young bottom  Lane you know after every couple kills  and he's going over there hugging them  and uh it really does seem like this fly  Quest  team deserves to be at the top and and  should should be projected to stay at  the top yeah I think one of the think  that to me was the big difference  between where they are and where I  expected them to be was I think that uh  masu and busio have been a lot better A  lot faster than I expected like I  thought that they could get there but I  wasn't really sure how good they would  be early on right and the reality is the  game is like largely played around about  bot Lane and if your Bot Lane's just a  black hole where everything goes to die  then uh you know you're not going to win  that many games but no they've actually  been really really solid um we saw them  absolutely clap a and Bot L which I  guess I guess a lot of people are kind  of doing these days we can get to that  later um but no they they just seem to  be kind of working really well together  um they're playing pretty confidently  they're like even in the games where  things are going wrong they still seem  to be able to play like pretty  aggressively and still kind of stay on  the right foot with that so it's been  really fun to watch because these are  two guys who you know are coming up from  naacl like relatively recently they both  won most valuable prospects so it's cool  to see that like some of this like na  Talent is actually doing well and I know  um I will dominate tweeted out really  just recently that he thought part of  the reason that this what was so  entertaining was not only the parody but  he thinks that mechanically um this is  like maybe the best LCS has been in a  long time you know and partially I think  that is because we have a lot of these  like new players coming up yeah I can  totally see that I think that  um I was going to say kind of contrary  to that that I think Flack Quest botlan  while they're they are doing you know  pretty solid they have shown some  weakness you know even in some of the  games they won they've had kind of rough  laning phases and I mean if you guys  remember fly quest one loss was probably  like the hardest loss any team has had  all split that was one where you know  botling energy yeah bot Lan just went  horribly in the beginning and then they  started like siphoning all resources to  try to stabilize and they just couldn't  get there so um I guess that's what I  was worried would happen in a lot more  games yeah I mean definitely not trying  to take anything away from them they've  done well I think that um it it's tough  you know coming into the league and I  wonder if other teams will start putting  more focused down there trying to  pressure them some and if they'll be  able to handle it yeah especially  everyone's thinking of the fly Quest  versus Cloud9 like kind of hype match up  where they're double killing  Berserker um and Vulcan multiple times  by themselves and like that started a  really hype super week I feel like fly  Quest being the only team to get a 30-0  super weak just feels like they have so  much momentum and that carried on too I  was like that was two really good Varys  games  uh for masu and then what was his other  champ that he played in the third game  uh is something else but it was pretty  it was pretty good well I think it was  aelio right he he was he was SC and that  was that that was decent too I just feel  like busio you know winning multiple  player of the games as well Nautilus  hooks on points just yeah definitely  definitely a lot better I feel like then  expected the timeline that was that was  set out oh that that Nautilus hook on uh  the yeah that lollipop that was so nasty  like dude people are flaming out line  say oh this just shows how n say it's so  easy to H hooks you still have to know  exactly where to throw it to not just to  have it hit the tower right like you you  go and do it then if it's so op like  like Nautilus can be annoying to play  against but I I like him I like when  naus is meta I think he makes things  happen like he's he'll he'll get a lot  of kills or he'll get a ton of deaths  like you know or both it's never going  to be a boring game when in it I I agree  and I mean it's like the hook the hook  cheats for sure but you like he was  abusing it to the maximum and that's  what a pro player should do right you  should be able to find those angles it's  like when I watch a really good bar  players like I play quite a bit of B and  the b q cheats a lot but some people go  for Q's that I would never even attempt  and it like hits them then turns  sideways in Hooks and I'm like how did  you even know that that was going to  work like that that angle looks like  that should never work they 100% cheat  it cheats like crazy but but knowing  exactly how far you can take it I think  really is a lot of it right um you know  especially on Champions that are not  super mechanically difficult it's all  about you know game knowledge and  understanding okay exactly like how far  can I go you know what's the difference  between the best nist player and the  worst na player exactly when you can  engage you know how to play out the  fights how you can abuse these things to  the maximum and that's always something  that I I've kind of found impressive um  about even some of the basic Champs it's  the same thing like Trin beir people  talk about you know as like this  Champion doesn't do anything you just  spin in and right click them but one  thing I've always found impressive about  like really really good trir players is  just their understanding of exactly when  they can dive people and exactly when  they can pull off these exactly when  they can crit yeah EXA true true true  same thing with Yumi like you need to  know exactly when you can just AFK on  your ad car the whole game when get a  snack you those Trend players watch  netfli know your bathroom timings you  popcorn  breaks um but bbo inspired and Jensen  also I think doing you know really good  job um J had a monster trist game this  week against uh dig after kind of the  trash talk back and forth about uh the  current crop of of Korean imports being  overrated uh he went up against do and X  was on that Pros with him so he was like  well we'll see how you do against do you  know blah blah blah and Jensen brought  out the Tristana played really well um  bipo has been playing a lot of different  stuff um inspired's been playing a lot  of different stuff even brought out the  brand and brand I think it was the only  brand game we had in the LCS which was  really surprising me because brand had  been turbo op in in Jungle it felt like  pretty much this entire season I think  Boogie also played him once oh did he  okay yeah um but I do agree he's real  strong in Soul C right now he's one of  the Champions getting hit next patch  it's hard for me to know exactly how  much those Nerfs are going to do but  Nerfs nonetheless especially because one  of the Nerfs is fixing a bug where his  passive was doing more than you know it  should that's really hard to quantify  how how much that is going to Nerf him  but it should it should be a decent tap  down I think that game specifically like  that was the masuo continual double  kills on Berserker Vulcan bottom and so  Inspire just got to free farm so it was  like kind of dream brand you just  farming away and your bottom Lane is  winning your Top Lane is a Cante so he's  fine up there it doesn't really matter  and then they were you know able to to  win the game despite JoJo having some  pretty good you know Nico engages that  gave Cloud9 just enough hope to be even  more sad at the end but I think this fly  Quest team I I 100% agree like they they  also are really flexible in the  Champions that they can use I think  that's a really good point to hit on  especially with how outspoken bppo is it  almost seems like he's like defensive of  his unique picks where when sniper  picked the Olaf he was tweeting out he  was like ah man that Olaf he missed the  double kill angle there these these  other players thinking that they know  what they could do with Olaf n it's it  felt like it's really he it's part of  his identity you know and he since  they're having so much success with it  like all the members get to you know  talk their trash see say whatever they  want have that confidence all right well  we have three teams tied in second right  now two of them are not really  surprising that they're like in second  uh energy you know Team Liquid two teams  I think were kind of predicted to be up  near top um but energy obviously coming  off a onew super week not going to be  that happy about it but TL and 100  thieves both went 2-1 in the super week  and for 100 thieves to be tied for  second is kind of shocking I know quite  a few people had them actually in eighth  even that I was seeing in some of the  community stuff I think I had them maybe  sixth or something like that I can't  remember if I had them fifth or sixth I  had them one Higher at fifth okay I  can't remember or if you had them at  fifth then I had them at Fourth like I  was only one higher than you guys which  was like I think I put Shopify above  them so I think I had them I had Shopify  then 100 thieves 5 six yeah but still  for them to be in second I think is  pretty crazy um and even talking to  Golden glue before the season and the  team you on their expectations I think  they're really surprised I think it was  golden even tweeted out like wait were  tied for a second you know like uh cuz  there's a lot of a lot of young players  a lot of new players on this team and I  think the expectation was definitely  that it was going to take a lot more  time for them to get up to speed and  even when they did I don't think they  really considered that they could be  competing you know this high up I think  a lot of people also expected quid to be  bad quid got a lot of flak last year and  when he was announced even on the  returning roster it was heavily  criticized I thought he he's been  actually great considering how much  criticism was thrown at him yeah there  definitely still are mistakes but like  the ability to pull out that atrox and  absolutely stomp Shopify this is  something I said on waiting room but  Shopify continually going with yeah  these unique picks of having multiple  tanks on their team I don't know if it's  Unique when it's three Scions it's not  unique anymore no that the Z gar Z Garen  okay the Garen was you you got a little  po there anyways my point my my point  was since they even if you're doing  something that's not meta if you  continually do that same thing then  you're you're just always playing your  own meta and people can counter that and  really big props to Golden glue as well  as quidd as well as uh Sam Spooks the  assistant coach for 100 thieves they did  exactly what I was hoping for they  crafted a team that will [ __ ] on tanks  and they did just that with their with  their double solo counter pick and they  absolutely like steamroll it because  even if you're doing your wacky stuff  that's off meta if you keep doing it  then someone's going to pull up the  counter and that's exactly what we want  you know that  flexibility and and that reactivity and  it does shine through but only if you  have players that are one willing and  two capable to be also flexible like  that one thing that's interesting about  hun thieves is of their five players um  only sniper and meech have played the  same champ more than once uh jungle mid  and support have all played a unique  champ in every single game which you  know it does show um you know diversity  and what they want to play it might mean  they don't necessarily know what's best  or they just have a really wide array  that they're comfortable with not really  sure yet it'll take some more time one  thing that I do Wonder watch though I  will say I've loved the varet oh yeah I  who doesn't I think that I I always have  this question in the back of my head  it's like like how much of the standings  right now are just who which the the  best team seem to be the ones that like  understand Lucian sucks and I know we  talked about this in another episode but  like it's it's every week every week  people pick him it's not even it's just  like man this is a really good Lucian  game I'm going to pick him it's just  like first pick me Lucian it feels it  feels kind of stubborn too I mean we  we'll talk more about Cloud9 but like it  it's it's almost to the point where it's  just losing every time and then they  lose they get flamed for it and they're  like you know what you're wrong I'm  going to I'm lose again it's not CU  Lucian guys like you guys messed up that  mid 2v2 our top Point had no pryo like  dude I was winning my lane from levels  three to four like from levels three to  four actually Elan won one game uh it's  not every game that he's lost thank you  was on the winning team actually he was  on the winning team he was like zero2  and one when the the game was almost  over like I don't know man a dub is a  dub yeah no it it is true and I'm so  curious to see if people are going to  kind of stick with it if they're going  to feel you know be stubborn and just  like no this is correct we're doing the  right pick we just have to nail down our  play or if they're going to move away I  think these new Zer and smolder are  going to force them to stop picking this  bait champion because I don't know like  it's it's almost hilarious seeing teams  just keep picking it and it's just  completely horrible every time it's  really funny too because Yan uh was on  hotline league with his coach spawn and  he had a message directly for the people  criticizing Lucian picks in Pro play and  I can't even repeat what he said be uh  because it was explicit and so beep  beze it and I'll keep just pointing to  the Willian win rate like go ahead and  pick him man if you think he's good play  him but I mean opponents will thank you  we can't even put the clip in the  comments or anything probably because  it's expl I was just say go check it out  it's uh it's pretty funny um quit quid  also I was just going touching on him he  actually had like stats obviously on  everything but um he's third in CSD he's  also third and highest DPM he's like you  know like he's actually like his Lane is  going pretty well he's contributing in  team fights he's actually having a  pretty good a pretty good season I  wouldn't say he's the best best  millionaire or anything like that um but  definitely I think it's it feels like a  far cry from uh last last year where he  was just getting roasted every week so I  do think he kind of deserves his flower  so to speak like he should get a little  bit of credit um because it feels like  everyone was telling me last year no no  no no no what you're seeing on stage is  not the real quid like he he he's better  just trust me but I feel like a lot of  times when you hear that stuff it never  actually pans out the person just keeps  playing like that on stage but he  actually has he has improved and he's  he's showing a lot better games on stage  I think absolutely hun thieves is for  sure one of the teams that has impressed  me most because coming into this split  you know I think all of us had them in  the bottom half the standings and when  you look at how they built their team it  almost felt like they weren't trying  right like of their roster last or  they're out of money they were  definitely  trying I'm just saying how it looks I'm  not saying how it is but I mean of their  roster last year quid received the most  criticism he's the only one they kept  they they put in uh like a bunch of  rookies or then they left out when River  golden Guardians exploded and they got  to get River yeah but I mean all all  that considered I think it it it's a  testament to you know doing something  right they're playing well it also for  me just makes me have even more respect  for River cuz he's a really good player  um and the fact that he just continually  finds success on any team he's he's on  other junglers have a lot of respect for  him uh I was asking Spa you know who's  the hardest jungler you've played  against he said River and so um he's a  demon in Solo que so that even further  emphasizes your point of any team that  he is on he he was at a 80% win rate in  in the top of Challenger I know spa and  a lot of people were talking about how  it like that's nuts it yeah I mean it's  it's just it's cool seeing them do well  especially with uh me and sniper coming  in both very green and pro play and  still managing to do pretty well yep uh  energy obviously bad super week it's  kind of interesting because last week we  were talking about oh yeah we really  thought energy was going to have this  slow start you know but hey it didn't  happen at all they didn't really run  into these issues because they were um  sitting at I guess three and one um  coming into Super week and and looking  pretty good and it seemed like they had  kind of escaped a lot of the issues that  people had been hearing that they had  been having that there' be you know some  difficulties incorporating um whoi and  now that's even been talked about you  know in some some interviews about oh  yeah we're kind of like arguing a lot on  the team and these types of things so  where do you guys stand on on energy now  you know like they're cing falling back  a little bit to where they were in  summmer Split where there's this  inconsistency where they can look really  good one day against a good team then  look really bad the next next day  against a bad team like have they  regressed is this just a blip on the  radar where do you guys stand I I still  think energy is pretty good uh when I  watch their games I'm not sitting there  being like wow this is a team that is  completely clueless they do not know  what they're doing um I think they're  solid you know they haven't won every  single game I think it is going to be  tough when you have you know a vocal  leader like who Who coming into an  established team there's going to be  some uh friction just getting everyone  on the same page it's natural totally  normal um and so yeah I wouldn't be too  worried if I was them I think they're  you know doing just fine yeah there I  feel there's two different issues one  could be this you know I don't think  arguing is inherently a problem as long  as they're no as it's productive exactly  and as long as they're able to work work  it out and I've heard from multiple  members on the team that they actually  like having a confrontational style and  bringing things up and then talking  through it sometimes I've also heard  like they spend way too much time on it  and so that can be a time sync which is  definitely an issue when you only have  one week and you know we're constantly  going to live patch and you really have  to be good with time management and what  you're going to practice uh and yeah  that can be a drag but I think some of  the things that might be a little  worrying are that there are some of  these like in-game mistakes that you're  going whoa like this does feel like  years past energy or even like CLG days  when we would be criticizing them for  like why are you over chasing here why  are you you know overextending diving  too far in what seems like and uh an  obvious like 20% chance of success type  of play was the Shopify game where they  had that horrible bot Lane dive yeah  that that was one of them um there have  been a couple of those a couple of  remember both of Shai's wins by the way  are off of the other team diving and  turbo inting and then getting slammed  they're just good at playing Dives yeah  they're smile the goats yeah there's  there's a reason we will get to them at  the bottom of the standings uh but  honestly I think that energy are going  to be fine and pull it back but these  These are the types of mistakes that  were kind of like I feel like used to  seeing from from that Squad and so it's  not completely surprising to me to see a  couple of them mhm as long as they reain  it in yeah I mean looking through their  games just both their losses were too  vars Veris a champion that's like the  reverse Lucian he's kind of just winning  every game I mean when there's a  champion that Holy the reverse Luan I  mean it it's this is how every split a  bow and arrow Lucian has two guns I'm  I'm telling you every single split this  will happen at the beginning of the  Season there's just winners and losers  in life Lucian is a loser ver is a  winner right it happens like people  don't always get the right read from  scrim sometimes they're a little  stubborn to change their mind and uh  yeah you know sometimes people will not  immediately recognize which Champs are  the best and it's hard to right like  there's so many factors going into a  game but uh definitely worth noting it's  definitely a scrim data thing too you  know anytime a champion is garbage on  stage and you talk to people like well  it's winning every game in scrims you  know people people always uh do kind of  fall into that did you did you ever had  any experiences with that when you guys  were playing um you know throughout your  career because it it does feel like such  an obvious trap like when you're on the  outside looking in right like when  you're watching the games as a co-  streamer or a Caster you're just like  just stop picking it dummies like it  clearly doesn't work it's losing every  time but then you talk to the pros and  and they're saying yeah but we played 20  games this week and it won all of them  you know what I mean and it's like how  how do you parse those two things and  make sure that you're you're not  actually just you know saying ah screw  Lucian because we lost once on stage  versus the 20 times you played in scrims  and making sure you're getting the right  info I mean it can be hard and you know  not everyone's going to get the right  read for sure I think you just have to  try to be open-minded and for me I  always try to understand like why  something happened more than just what  happened because something that would  trigger me a little bit is when we would  you know go into our draft meeting and  bring up win rates from scrims because  to me that doesn't matter like you can  lose a game that had absolutely nothing  to do with a certain Champion that was  played or vice versa you know win a game  that had nothing to do with it and then  you also have to look like what was  happening in the games were were you  picking this champ and they were limit  testing random matchups into it and  running it down was this Champion  getting overly fed every single game is  that a normal thing to happen um so just  where are the advantages and  disadvantages coming from like what's  expected to happen and you know that can  be very hard to keep everything in mind  yeah I mean like nobody can do it  perfect it's it's a something you just  always have to keep working at and so  yeah I mean there like bait picks come  up all the time yep absolutely um but  yeah I mean I'm kind of on the same page  I think energy can probably pull it back  um TL the other two in one team they had  a pretty good super week went 2 and one  um are you feeling are you guys feeling  like they're beating some of the  allegations as far as only being able to  play like scaling comps and whatnot or  does this kind of still feel that way  because I know that was kind of what I  felt like I'd been seeing I've been  seeing some other people echoing that  where it was just like all the previous  weeks they'd pickeling a little bit more  aggressive on day one lose and then day  two they're like zeri Lulu and air and  then you know like they lose again with  a little bit more aggressive and then  they're going okay we're going Tristana  and felios and three tanks uh I I  wouldn't say they're beating those  allegations because that's what they've  been doing pretty much like tank top  tank jungle APA on a scaling mid and  then like pretty much all range support  Spot Lane which you know it is a way to  play it's valid  it doesn't  necessarily show like work on a ton of  different things as a team right like  you don't necessarily get practice being  proactive like being really aggressive  putting the the pressure on the other  team so it is working for TL I would  like to see them try some other stuff  because I think only playing one way you  know it's not flexible what if the meta  changes what if people come up with  strats that are really good against what  you're doing so um yeah I I would like  to see them try other stuff I mean this  this last week in super week they played  they had the one Lucian uh game they had  one felos game that had one Ezreal game  I think the biggest part of their wins  has actually just been impact on uder in  impact on uder has done so much he has  one mid lane twice for APA by roaming  down there he has won jungle multiple  times by invading jungle killing enemy  jungler not killing enemy jungler but  harassing enemy jungler and then and  stealing camps I prob impact is playing  out of his mind right now uh there have  been a couple points where even um in in  the content that they're releasing  afterwards uh like you know like umpty  goes one way and the the like the rest  of the team was like going trying to go  the other way or something like that I  think that one change we are going to  see though for sure is that APA is GNA  play even more but I don't even know if  this a change because he's already  played a bunch of zigs but zigs is  getting buffed so he's going to keep  playing zigs and guess what that's  really good with scaling because you  have super good wave clear and two  seconds off your SEL charge does make  you safer and as well as the extra  little bit of armor that he's getting so  I think that Team Liquid will probably  play still pretty similarly I like they  are open to  doing obviously Del Luan bottom lanes  and a little bit of aggressive stuff cor  JJ is in my opinion always best when  he's on engaged supports and is like  creating action for them so um I'm I'm  not particularly super worried about  them only being a scaling team I think  they can be a super action pack team but  we have when they we have seen yeah we  have seen some of the mistakes coming in  those mid game you know either going to  the objectives or the team fight  actually at them yeah for for sure um  definitely nothing in their play is  indicated they can't play other styles  but like I said I just want to see it  because there there have been those uh  you know narratives floating around  impact can't play carries uh APA can't  play you know assassins or whatever and  I don't know if it's true probably not  but so far we've seen them pretty much  sticking to what works range support  scaling mid tank top and I think we'll  probably continue to see that yeah I  mean it's it's not a bad way to play  it's one of the like probably the most  common way to play of of all time in  league but you know a little bit of  flexibility is not a bad thing  absolutely well as long as you have at  least enough Champions within that that  if you go into playoffs you can't just  get targeted out right um I impa can  play a ton of Tanks I'm I'm not really  worried about that but every single win  they have is with him playing uder and  uder is actually 10-2 in LCS um I think  it's probably the highest win rate  champion in the LCS with like any number  real number of games um and yeah APA  obviously it is still big concern for  him like what the champion pools is  looking like I think because that was  one of the big criticisms and kind of  questions people had coming into this  split and I don't feel like he's really  changed any Minds because he's just  played the three Champs his year zigs  and Tristana which were three that like  he was already kind of playing and  obviously there was already some  criticism to how he's kind of playing um  the the azir but either way I think  they're they're doing pretty well it  feels like on is fitting into the team  pretty well um I don't feel like there  was any it seems like there any big  downgrade from piosik or anything um  maybe maybe Mt is a little bit less  proactive I guess than piosik it feels  like when piosik had his best games it  was him just kind of like taking over  the game like as as an individual  whereas umt it feels like his good games  are more enabling his  team yeah yeah uh either way they're  sitting at four and three doing pretty  well uh the next teams down in fifth  three and four are Cloud9 and Immortals  which is honestly shocking to say that  they're tied yeah I think we we had them  as first and eighth in their tied right  now I mean I don't know I'm 03 super  week for Cloud9 it had nothing to do  with me being a conator for Cloud9 but  like like they're not a fifth place I'm  sorry like they're not they're not I  would still probably put him first if if  I was betting on who's going to win the  split it would still be C9  because I mean look at their losses  they're trolling in most the games like  they wi they lost when you do it four  times in a row how much can you forgive  it's the Lucian they lost with Lucian  and then they pick Lucian again and  guess what happened they lost again I  don't know aren isn't it more problems  if you just want to criticize draft  can't you criticize more than just  solution they went they went against C  it was so funny we interviewed the  players we interviewed APA and uh and  JoJo before this game and JoJo's like  yeah he's only a zigs one trick you take  him off that you know he's he's bad  basically and then they give them zigs  and pick Lucian and give over I think  even uder as well it was it was like  their opponents are just getting to play  Blind pick like they're just loading in  and picking whatever they want so it's  like that's that's a problem that means  you suck at drafting it it does but at  the same time like I don't know if you  saw uh I think JoJo did an interview  with with Ashley yeah I saw it and he's  saying like you know uh it's more fun  this way than if we just Stomp the Le C  it's kind of cope but at the same time  having so much fun losing four straight  games they did you see the players face  this they were having a lot of fun yeah  I mean they were loving it they were  they were having highing you know dude  like put him in playoffs have like put  him in games that matter and I guarantee  we're GNA not see this at least I hope  to God we don't see this uh because you  know the longer the The Meta goes on the  more people start realizing like you're  not just going to ignore a champ being  10 and two or Varys is like 10 and five  or something you're not just going to  keep picking the champion that's never  winning I think that putting Cloud9 on a  good draft they're probably just going  to win so like I haven't my faith in  them hasn't wavered I think they  definitely made a lot of mistakes in  game two I like you you you can't say  like they also had a horrendous bottom  Lane dive they they also had a bunch of  int moments which you can say they're  trolling cuz you know they're good  players right individually I'm like I  agree with you I know these guys are  good players individually think be but  if you are trolling 50% of your games  you're a bad player like you're a 50%  player then if you if you're trolling  half the time then that's that's you  medus is on the campaign Trail here he's  doing some good work for clown9 but like  okay they're not immune to criticism  like I think I think re for blabber is  not his best Champion like I'm I'm a  blabber stand agre that's not his reals  look pretty rough like he never runs hex  flash on real he he hasn't even been  ganking though which has been bizarre  yeah I mean that that's the thing like  to me re is a contracts Champion 100%  like re is great if you're looking to  play around your lanes to not just like  yeah she's got good clear speed but  you're playing well so getting super  ahead doesn't actually do anything uh  you really want hex flash to make more  plays happen so I think he's just kind  of slotting re into the way he regularly  plays Jungle which is kind of like a  more carry style which you know I I  don't think that works too well I don't  think that's what you want weird because  he's he's like one of his most  successful Champions has been like maai  and stuff right like he can play that  style of champ so I don't I don't know  but it has has been not not Rift maker  Malai that was the most garbage build of  all time um but I mean yeah I think that  Cloud9 can absolutely bounce back from  this I think they're insanely talented  but I also think we can't Overlook okay  clearly there's drafting issues but also  I mean to me the worst bot Lane thing  that I've seen in a while it felt like  from players of this quality was the one  against uh fly Quest where it wasn't  even I think it was the the initial dive  they trolled the dive and died but there  was this one fight afterwards that  actually just tilted me off the face of  the planet where they were looking for  this 2v2 and people were talking about  oh like um buio swept so it took Vision  away from the ward in in the in the bush  and maybe he berser could have finished  all but yeah but it's like so maybe he  could have traed the kill maybe but he  loses three waves like and it would have  been a one for one like it was there's  just no world in which it is good right  like that wasn't even execution that was  just like you are tilted for sure you're  that was that was a tilt play for sure  yeah there's just no way you fight there  ever right if we're tilted and trolling  half the time then we're 50% players I'm  just it's fine man turn it on when it  matters they seem so inactive in the  early game which is one of the things  that really I felt was bizarre watching  three St games I think it was the  Mortals game that was C with flowers and  we were 31 minutes in and I think Cloud9  has zero kills it it was 1 to zero at  like 31 minutes I don't think I'm  exaggerating no I think you're right I  remember I I was going through the  scores and I think it was like that game  ended like six to1 in kills or something  in two of cloud n's losses they had  players with zero deaths which yeah is  pretty they just weren't even trying  place which is bizarre because I always  think of Cloud9 as as one of the more  like proactive teams the teams that like  is going to go down without a fight if  they start losing they're going to make  things H they're going to try you know  what I mean um but yeah that was one of  the weirdest Parts about all these  losses for me was it just felt like they  kind of just sat back and I don't know  if they were just thinking okay my  opponent's going to make a mistake and  then we're going to capitalize on it  let's just keep waiting they're going to  make a mistake they're going to make  mistake they're mistake and then they  just didn't or what the plan was like I  don't know what the comms were there or  if they thought that they were going to  like outscale and they didn't need to  fight or what but yeah those games were  wildly inactive and it it is pretty  shocking uh um how how this team has  looked over the last four games because  they've looked really bad over the last  four games they've definitely not looked  good I'm just going to say let's wait to  see them on a game where they're not  horrendously outd drafted before we jump  to any  conclusions I I was going to say too I  did see the ashle king interview that  you're talking about with Jojo and he  was supremely confident he was saying  all the same things as you he was like  yeah we're just trolling we he said that  we have the best players in every role  he was like we you know as soon as we  work together a little bit and as soon  as we fix our draft then everything's  going to be fine I do think like you  know when you're on a team you have to  project that type of confidence but they  should also as long as they are also  examining these games and and you know  in review and making sure taking steps  to make sure that you don't make these  types of mistakes or and working out  communication you know whatever it's  going to be rubric for for the games so  that you don't make some of these calls  or you can put a stop to some of these  calls before they happen  and as long as they're examining the  losses so that they don't happen again  rather than just being like ah we were  trolling it's not going to happen again  because if you just say that then it  probably will good review guys high five  ah we were trolling review done which I  don't think that they would be doing  that I mean I I will say I'm still  giving them definitely benefited out I  would not be shocked if they still won  because the amount of on this team but  it does start to feel a little bit like  fly quest in summer we like well they  were so good in Spring they're going to  turn it around guys they're going to  turn of course they're well next week  for sure well playoffs come on guys you  know and it's like at a certain point  you have to do it and um and the season  goes really really fast it's a six week  season we are halfway done if they if  they have another 02 week or something  then there's not going to really be any  time to turn it around so I think they  have to start making it work but should  we jump on to Immortals who had uh a  good weekend they went two- one this  weekend um which was pretty exciting and  I think the only loss that they had I  felt it was a pretty big draft Gap and I  think sharks even tweeted out you know  my bad kind of trolled the draft or  whatever because that one was uh if I  I'm looking back yeah it was the double  they basically they had Zack top they  had uh re TK Senna and then Jace so they  basically had two lethality damage  dealers and then they're playing against  Cante and uh and poy and I just remember  sniper walking at their backline 1 V2  all game long and they can't even move  his health right so like that one felt  doomed from draft for me but the other  two games they won and they look pretty  solid I mean wins against energy and  Cloud9 that's that's good two of the  worst teams in the league two of the  worst teams yeah I mean uh good for that  Energy's died for a second okay let's  let's  relax yeah he on super leue performance  that's a zero3 team and a one two team  Kobe it is uh I didn't want to like  interrupt your flow but real real quick  on that cuz I thought it was cool Medio  said he would still predict Cloud9 to  win bet if I was going to predict right  now I would I would definitely take the  field if you're going to give me the  field but I I would I would you like to  be involved in your first ever dive bet  we've had a proud history of having to  do ice baths and wear embarrassing  cosplay and other things I mean I would  bet depending on the stakes I don't know  if I want ice  bath uh all right what what Stakes  should we maybe we have to determine  Stakes later though cuz German Stakes  we'll come back to if you guys are  willing to do a  bet won't be big Stakes okay okay you  can't take the field though you got to  take a team can I get two teams you can  have two teams okay I'll take energy and  fly Quest okay that's a bet all right  we'll we'll we'll we'll come up with the  Stak we'll have the stakes for next week  okay that they'll agree upon because we  don't want to waste too much time  thinking about that but there you go  first bet uh just for fun what would  what would your team to predict if I had  take two teams if you could predict  right now would you predict predict  Cloud9 or would you take two other teams  I would still predict Cloud9 okay I I I  still I still have now we get a test  wait do you want in on the BET how does  that even work either well depending on  the on the rewards either both of you  lose or both of you win and I'm the only  one who who cares all right we're in  there um yeah I mean you probably have  better odds I think yours is the smarter  bet but but if I was but you you asked  me if I want to pick one team but I  either way I I still believe they get  they could turn it around um yeah  Immortals Immortals I think has been  doing a lot better it's also fun for me  to see a team that everyone was like  this team is trash actually do well and  not only pick up some wins but put up  fights and some of their losses also um  it was kind of cool I actually went I  saw some of their scrims um flowers I  went into their compound last week  before their games um on the day before  super week uh and then they they won the  next day and they're like well you guys  are come back next week right um but  yeah no it was It was kind of cool  seeing some of the things that they were  working on and even some of the things  that we saw them practicing in scrims  then bring out on stage uh not all of it  worked and not all of it worked like the  way that they were talking about in  scrims but it was it was interesting to  see some of the stuff that they were  working on like as a squad some of the  things that they were focusing on can  you share what things anything  interesting I mean you leak all their  pics I me definitely leak all the pics  uh I mean I think I I would say that one  of the really big things that they were  focusing on was was communication and um  I I think this would be fine for me to  share is just like for example like  their they were all like communicating  pretty well as far as just like General  stuff but they wanted to be really  focused on more like what the goals  needed to be in the game so it's like  more talking about like what you need as  a player to succeed in the game versus  like what is happening like everyone's I  think was talking a lot about like okay  you know he's going to be there this is  happening now I'm going to reset you  know they're talking about that stuff  but I think they were trying to like  really improve on okay how do we win  this game okay we need to get the dragon  so then we need to be talking about okay  how do we get the dragon so then we need  to be talking about okay when are we we  going to base what our base timing is  going to be how are we going to set up  vision and like where do you need a ward  for a flank you know all these sorts of  things those kind of next steps because  it felt like all the players watching  them were actually doing really well  individually like as far as the scrims  were going mechanically they all seemed  like they were doing well like  everything was working but they felt  like that next step was what they were  trying to work towards is really being  cohesive on where they want to go in the  game and how to get there and so I think  it was kind of fun to see that and it'll  be interesting to see if they can you  know like watching them through that  lens I could kind of see how they were  trying to work on that on stage yeah I  kind of miss the the scrim culture I  guess in that way uh cuz I did something  similar with C9 like a week or two ago Y  where I was just stopping by the house  to like talk to Jack and a scrim was  going on so I just watched the game and  like it it really brought back a lot of  good memories for me just like the stuff  that happens in scrims that like you  don't really see outside of it like I  don't know people just like getting  really tilted just like crazy allins  that you would never see otherwise it's  just like Yep this is a scrim there  there are some pretty there's some  pretty troll scrims I would say there at  least the scrims I watched were pretty  disciplined overall but there was one  like five minute remake that was pretty  funny where it was just an all out brawl  yeah you'll see that it's like I it used  to be it's probably still the case if  gang blink ever comes back into the meta  like my God it's it's so demonic bro  like the game will be decided by level  one Top Lane someone's winning or going  Z1 like there was a this game that lives  rentree in my head and I can probably  talk about it cuz there's long time ago  now it was an echo fox versus CLG scrim  from forever ago right yeah it was every  game and I watched this whole scrim  block and it was like game one level one  fight to the death between him and I  think it was like Dara or something at  the time this level one fight to the  death remake game two uh there's like a  fiveman invade for for red buff and the  other team's fiveman stacked at Red buff  both top laners die both TP back to the  level one fight and I'm just like  there's no way you would do this you  could never convince me in a million  years they would be tping back and it  was it was like the the blue team's red  buff so it's bot Lane that their team  being back to basically like and I was  just like it was so funny man into an  instant remake into game three was a  level one fight to death  into great info gained I I swear like  literally back in our first LCS split  there was uh you know the team they had  like a ton of different names like  Vulcan xdg and stuff but but that team  we would have the most curs scrims  against them like I remember one time it  was like an hour of straight remakes it  would be like we were just level one  fighting each other to the death every  time and I'm sitting there like guys  what are we doing like this is such a  waste of time and and then and lemon  were like no they don't win this fight  if they take this fight we're fighting  him I'm just like bro this is literally  never going to happen in a game like  what are we  doing it was crazy it so funny uh yeah  there's some there's some really funny  stories from scrims but I I will say in  the scrims I've watched in recent years  overall all I feel like people are more  disciplined than the the wild west days  that I used to watch them in dude I I  gotten the most arguments probably like  90% of my arguments were just with  teammates doing things that I'm like  you're not going to do this on stage  like you're griefing us and our our  scrim opponents like I would literally  be like dude this team's not going to  play against us again if we're doing  this like this is so ridiculous please  stop yeah it is really really funny and  some teams do lose scrim Partners I know  if they're if they're trolling too hard  especially if you're a lower ranked team  it becomes a bit of like a privilege to  play the higher ranked teams you know  cuz they have their scrim Bubbles and  you can get dropped as a scrim partner  if you're trolling too hard cuz if  you're wasting their time next one  people talk a lot about that at Worlds  and I know there were some teams that  were like oh man but then the the  Eastern teams are always going to beat  us in these level ones and we're always  going to lose from there so that's why  we have to do this we have to test our  Extremes in the level ones and the Allin  it's like you really stage no nope wrong  I think I think for those things to me  that is always stood out as something  that's like you don't need to fight till  the death level one in a five versus  five scrim just get into a custom game  and run to level ones if you if you must  figure out if GP and Renekton Auto  attack each other to death at level one  who wins then go do it but like don't  waste everyone else's time with it do it  in a custom game one-on-one uh but that  stuff was pretty funny we got a little  bit off track but yeah Immortals  Immortals per has has been fun to watch  and that has been one of the things that  I think has been the biggest pleasant  surprise for me is that you know teams  like Mortals in Shopify and DS that I  didn't really expect a lot from and even  Hunter thieves as well who has done even  better than that uh they are all feeling  competitive even if they are losing none  of the games just feel like this given  game where there's a lot usually like  when you're looking at strength of  schedule in in previous splits almost  every split you look three and you're  like okay well this is this is like  first versus eth or like this is second  versus ninth or whatever you're like  okay well that's a guaranteed win this  is a guaranteed win this is a guaranteed  win when I'm looking at strength of  schedule I don't really feel like that  with pretty much any of the games cuz  everyone is kind of at least showing  that they can be competitive even if  they can't close close out wins 100% I  mean even just looking at the standings  there's there's no zero7 team the worse  is two and five which that's super close  two games between second and seventh  yeah and it shows in the games too it's  not just like oh you know this is how it  turned out with the with the wins and  the losses like there are a lot of  really really competitive moments and  that's what the conversation about that  LCS being a very competitive league this  year um I feel like just shows up in  every single weekend that we have yeah  and hopefully it'll continue being that  way um down in seventh is Shopify and  dignitas who are both winning one and  two this weekend they're both two and  five shopify's two wins are against  energy and  C9 um again the worst teams in the  league you know the easy easy teams they  both had Scion mid as well which I mean  and uder  top interesting the tanks I don't love  it like you know it's kind of what we're  saying about TL is like I don't think  just winning in one way is super  beneficial to your team especially when  mid doesn't count and losing with Lucian  doesn't count kind of like like kind of  kind of uh I don't know it it just  doesn't feel like solid gameplay it kind  of feels like you're cheesing them which  not to take away from them I don't think  Shopify is bad by any means I just think  that uh I would like to see them play a  little bit more normal I don't think you  need to try to cheese everyone you ever  play um and I would like to see how they  do with a more standard game plan I mean  I I think it's fine to have this as uh  one of your strategies but it can only  be one like I was saying earlier if you  keep doing the same thing even if it's  something that nobody else is doing  people are going to recognize that  pattern and they're going to build  counters specifically for you like  hundred thieves did and dump on you so  going to be playing against you've  already you've already used up your  surprise Factor so unless you have  another iteration or you are the one  ready with Innovations and and  corrections to what you think people are  going to try and play into you then  you're going to you're really going to  lose out because then you become the  predictable one and you're kind of  making your opponent be the creative one  by coming with their counter already  prepared for you so that's my biggest  worry I guess for Shopify and the thing  that's going to hinge on this week's  practice the most uh how much work they  put into actually regaining the surprise  Factor or the upper hand in them knowing  their strategy better than you do  because if you know their strategy just  as well as they do uh and have a and pre  and come with a counter then it's going  to fail yeah like I would push back a  little bit on on like the cheese win  stuff because I don't think there's  anything wrong inherently with just like  playing off meta but I do think I agree  in that you can't just play the same  thing every time like when Insanity last  split was playing off meta stuff he was  playing like Graves mid and things that  were wildly different right so to me  it's like if he just wants to be play  never play a single game of his year  this whole split and he's just going to  play different stuff I think that's fine  but if you're just going to be doing the  same thing every time then yeah people  are going to pre- counter it and it's  going to become a problem but it's like  if he wants to if he wants to go from  Sion mid and then next week he's playing  like brand and zerth and you know velos  and whatever it's like okay I I will  make the distinction I think there's a  pretty big difference between those kind  of like artillery Mages and Scion and  garz like you know no offense to  Insanity uh but those are like that's  the champ I would put my mid laner on if  like he's just worse than all my  opponents right like if I was a jungler  and I somehow got autofilled into LCS  mid I'd be like give me something easy  just give me something that I will not  rolled over on or I can still be useful  even if I get rolled on because like  Canon's not really winning Lane against  anything he's just kind of enduring the  laning phase and then being useful  afterwards and I know insanity is a good  player like he if he wants to play  Innovative picks great I have no issue  with that I think it's just like when  you're trying to just take the easy way  out and pick some nonp punishable champ  that's kind of like eh that's only going  to get you so far to play Devil's  Advocate do you do you still think it's  basically like incorrect if their read  is just that tank itemization is so op  that it's actually like this is actually  just the best way to play the game I  mean if if they truly believe that then  right I don't think it's wrong but I  think that that's probably not the case  yeah and I think they're making them  their comp worse by also picking the  Cante and an Nautilus with a Scion game  then you could running three of these  low damage tanks and I mean this example  of the 100 thieves game is just the the  most like lopsided example that I could  pull from because that was a really good  drop at 100 thev so smart not only is it  the atrox but they also have the Lilia  to annihilate both of them with  leandre's uh and passive stacking and  they have Olaf for Sniper it's like  every single person and then they back  up all these short range melees with a  senat Lane and you're just like oh my  God this is the perfect anti- Shopify  Rebellion strategy and then they even  triple down on the tanks without damage  type of type of build here for them so I  feel like they even more self- countered  it was it was really interesting though  because I I remember even in that game  um Boogie got what was it three or four  early kills on the brand I can't  remember how many but he got some early  kills and APA was casting the game and  they're they're asking him oh which  which team do you think has the better  spot and he was like basically saying he  thought shop five was going to win for  sure MH that he thought they they had a  better spot that brand was just going to  win the game basically um so it's it's  interesting right so it's like even in  that that game they like at least APA  still believed that there was a way  dise yeah you never believed I disagree  watching the game you never believe no I  was maybe it's because I I just have had  so many scenarios where you just you get  to the point where the Champions that  are like drain tanks get to run through  pure Tank teams and Lilia atrox and Olaf  are all those classification of the  healing drain tanky do way more damage  than a tank but also annihilate them  class and they have good ways to  actually pressure and kill brand as well  yeah and you've got a Sen Tom kench too  even even if one of them does Get Low  you have a Tom kench and the Senate  healing and shielding I was just like oh  my God this is this is crazy that tough  I was like damn golden glue is a genius  yeah well we'll see we'll see if shop  Cooks up anything new this weekend or if  they're going to continue on the tank  train uh dig toss the last team down at  1 and two this weekend um you know  they're a team I feel like I I still  would say they're overperforming  expectations um but I think they're the  team that people have the least hope for  I don't know if you guys agree with that  I I was actually going to say I have  them up there with 100 thieves as far as  surpassing my expectations cuz I think  even though dick hasn't been winning a  lot of their games like they are  competitive they they're playing a  pretty good game even when they don't  manage to win XU has impressed me a lot  almost every game he's going for some  kind of early invade like take my  Raptors walk into your jungle scrap With  the Enemy jungle like XU has been really  good and I know going back to our didn't  you put them Eights on the jungle T and  I I was P XU yeah but like it's it's not  like eight means he's bad it just means  everyone's good and somebody's got to be  eth and I haven't seen him enough but  he's been really impressive to me did he  move up in the tier list what's the  updated power ranking for XU I dude want  to put m in the same tier like it's e  Toth that's the new update no I'd maybe  move him up but who else is going to be  eth then I don't know man but he's been  good he's been really good especially  for a new player I like the confidence  he plays with obviously not perfect he  Mak some mistakes like anybody but I I  just like watching the way they play  they've been kind of doing their own  thing with picks as well they're not um  just sticking to one style but I think  this is actually a team that I have uh I  have hope for I think that you think  they could go up and I don't think  there's any match dig is going to go  into where I'm like yeah they're just  GNA get rolled there's there I don't  feel about any team I don't feel like  that for any team which is yeah comes  back to like the the competitive LCS  split that we're having but yeah I I  guess Immortals and dig are the two  examples of coming into the split where  pretty much everybody's you're just so  used to like oh yeah those are throwaway  games I definitely agree with you I  don't feel I don't feel like that for  immortals games anymore I don't feel  like that for TOS games at all I will  say one thing I'm I'm kind of  disappointed with and maybe this is  coloring my my perception a little bit  is that I had higher expectations for  Rich I thought Rich was actually really  good last split or last year I guess it  was overall um this split I feel like he  hasn't been performing yearly as well he  has not been nearly as much of a  standout um for me so I feel like Dove  and exu and and stuff have definitely  overperformed compared to where I  expected but I felt like rich is kind of  underperformed and I I guess I struggled  to see them climbing the sings I do  think that they're competitive but yeah  you also think Dove has overperformed  expectations uh well I feel like  people's expectations for him was that  he was going to be really trash so yeah  I would say so  okay I mean is that wrong I feel like  everyone was flaming this guy when dius  announced the the pickup yeah I guess  people only yeah people were telling me  that he's like not even like not even  deserving to be in any tier one League  period let alone let alone like be a  decent mid lader the league yeah I mean  it's tough to say I guess I hadn't heard  much about him at all good or bad which  you know from lot of people I've talked  to is kind of similar so I think he's  done all right you know nothing crazy uh  he's had some standout performances like  some good plays also some some ins but  uh I I don't have any strong opinion on  him either way yet one thing interesting  is that rich hasn't played any uder and  I know he's lost against uder a lot so  what's really weird about about that is  he was one of the ones spamming it in  Champs Q too so I was coming into this  thinking that dig were going to have a  high priority on it and they just  haven't so I yeah I also thought that  was weird um he also hasn't like last  year he was doing Quinn counter picks  and all these like Lane bully counter  picks yeah Quinn ala stuff yeah that I  was kind of hoping for for a bit more  especially because the way they changed  Top Lane this year where it's harder to  gank you know you're more isolated I was  like oh this is going to be even better  for dignitas and Rich's style of let me  get a kind of isolated counterpick V top  has been uh pretty popular in solu also  stuff like that you know where you're  you're going to try and be abusive I  don't know and and isolated but he stuff  we had atrox gragas rumble or Poppy and  Nar Nar the Nar one I think was a  counterpick Nar which um you know had  the possibilities of being cool but I  don't think that Champ's very good hro  is another one that's kind of looking  like a bait pick at this point he's lost  like I love the profane  Hydra I feel like it does bad in every  game I'm with you man I think atrox has  been looking awful in Top Lane I think I  I don't know if the Champion's like  insane or not I think people might be  building him into like the profane Hydro  lethality in situations where you might  not want that I think there are times  where it's good you know if you're  really ahead but if it's the default  that you're going to every single game  because I see so many fights where atro  just goes in and just gets one shot and  that's not very good though especially  there have been a lot where they have no  tank jungle and no tank support I feel  like every time there's there's that  scenario you should be the Bruiser build  yeah you need your entry frager you need  like the guy who just goes in like  before it worked well with Gore drinker  but like now you can kind of do with  like sunro Sky uh ster type items like  you need someone who can just go in tank  their spells and hopefully not instantly  die yeah I mean to to me hoox is getting  picked all the time as an answer into  uder they just build lethality lose Lane  generally or go even at at best into  uder and then they have this like super  tank on the other side that's just  running around slowing everyone stunning  everyone HX never feels like it's  getting those highlight moments there's  so much peel in the game I feel like  right now as well um that it's very  difficult for him to without setup like  you guys are talking about so I don't  know I mean maybe it's a build thing  maybe it's just a matchup thing maybe  it's just an uder so strong thing but  like you know uder and atrox are on two  opposite ends of the spectrum as far as  how Top Lane picks are performing uh  udor is 83% win rate hro is 22% win rate  in the LCS and yeah I just feel like  udar has been looking and one of those  atrox games is mid- atrox from quidd  this is specifically top unless you  highlight it only top cuz like there  there have been some good atrox picks  but yeah they have been a lot fewer and  and usually the ones that I like are  when they do have engage from Jungle or  support and yeah the uh the winds have  been from Castle on Immortals two of  yeah everyone else who's tried a truck  has lost and I think that you know like  you were saying Aro does play that like  tanky engage style which obviously is  going to enable a TRS a lot better than  some other stuff yep well it's been a  really fun split so far I've been  enjoying it a lot I hope that we keep up  the the compet the competitiveness and I  hope that it's not just one of those  things where it's just like okay and  everything went back to how you expected  it right in the second half um but it's  going to be fun uh remember that is  going to be wrapping up for us for now  um but if you're

on how have you been great how how  are how are you I've seen you around  with Shopify mhm Shopify has been great  coaching the team hanging out on the  sidelines losing week one you know it  was  good  you forgot to mention one thing what it  was your damn birthday yesterday it was  it was I'm 29 now let's go you're oldest  H I love that picture yeah it's really  funny what did you end up doing  yesterday oh just hanging out watching a  movie just chilling eating dinner going  to sleep I don't know so you're more  lowke Keepers cuz for me I just don't  generally tell people when it's my  birthday and I do nothing I don't really  celebrate my birthday I just play video  games historically I just play video  games and like you know blast playing  Lego or something yeah uh there is some  there's some tape online though of what  else you've been up to yes yes it's a  it's a video Shopify film for us check  it out let's  goally a meal we challenged wild turtle  and Tomo to grocery shop with a $25  budget but what they didn't know was  that they had to make a meal out of  their purchases let the best Shopper win  all right let's get a  basket yeah specifically blueberries why  are these ones so large they're like GMO  favorite type of you know I'm just going  to get roasted turkey call me weird if  you'd like part of the challeng is to  make a meal out of your materials you  have 20 minutes and your time starts now  I'm going to put them down individually  and that's it guys ladies and gentlemen  the final  product hello hello everybody it's me Mr  turtle and here is my dish the wild  turkey the thing about a pumpkin  chocolate chip is a well I just wanted  to get some chocolate chips at the  grocery store and The Raspberries a  great source of fiber and vitamin C and  you know this blueberry is Jed out of  its mind so I'm sure it's also pretty  good I got the proteins from the cliff  bar and let me know what you  think  oo that's pretty solid is that me  wrapping the  cookie it was a pumpkin cookie I didn't  even know what I was getting I thought  it was chocolate chip it just happened  to be  pumpkin you ate it right yeah I ate it  all all it it was fine it was okay just  didn't expect it to be pumpkin flavored  I bathroom trip half  your I would not be a good  trip I knew it was over when you spent  half of your budget on coffee I was like  oh no oh I didn't realize we had to like  make food it was a bait and switch yeah  it was a bait and switch yes yes anyways  new patch uh we'll see what teams have  been cooking up because we are on the  live patch we're the only professional  League major region in the world that  will be on 14.3 and see that little  dragon that's smolder I see him oh old  there we can play smolder today today  nice teams can play smolder or a reling  soul hot fix reling Soul true but  they've had just as much time to adjust  to this stuff as the people at home we  got to pick all the dragons now like  shyana asil the full Dragon full Dragon  comp Year of the Dragon something like  that yeah dragon fist Le in let's pass  let's look at the at the overview of  what's happened so far because obviously  smolder has been released asol had a  bunch of changes Karma eal nerfed what  stands out uh Emily to you so far in the  patch Zar is back or she might be  back yeah we don't know I mean she was  kind of getting picked in like some  outlier cases uh and then obviously I'm  not going to necessarily take what  happened in NAC yesterday uh because  they were actually the first  or like development league on the patch  yeah but they're also in Fearless draft  so it makes sense uh this is obviously  uh one of our best Zer players in the  league right now in Berserker and people  are kind of wondering with the Zer Buffs  to this patch um whether it is enough  for to see something like this out of C9  because historically this has been a  champion on which Berserker has been  able to Showcase his team fighting  prowess uh as as you see she had base a  debuffs and uh a cool down reduction on  her ultimate so um I mean I I think Zer  was kind of getting picked in outlier  situations anyway with the  metric like ton of botling bands we've  seen across the board these are really  solid Buffs but also I think the items  um like the Kraken Slayer and the static  sh is actually a really good addition to  like static sh losing 300 gold on the  purch price is pretty pretty amazing to  get for her yeah and you you want to  build that early on Zer yeah you just  get it and then you can Farm even faster  than before um a little questionable  about the hex play I don't know if it's  a good item on Ziri quite yet but I  prefer getting navori second still so  you think she's in a good spot right now  yeah well I always kind of liked Zer I  don't know if you if anyone's been  watching my streams but I play zeri like  24/7 almost so oh then you're perfect  for today if she ends up coming out um  for me uh like it's going to be  interesting with a lot of I guess newer  things being thrown bot Lane overall  like yes we already talked about smolder  coming through a weaker laner overall  and I wonder if people are going to  prioritize the pick and if they can  protect it uh to me the patch changes  that I'm interested in is actually like  the karma Nerfs umh because she was  thrusted into the meta with pretty large  ratio changes to make her uh pretty  difficult to deal with at least in the  draft because people expected  immediately that they' be playing Karma  mid uh with malignants maybe even like  Top Lane but a lot of teams ended up  flexing it to the bot Lane with Ezreal  and so the Buffs to Ezreal the buff to  certain items like uh to like I guess  the um Essence Reaver items in the  previous patch like it made it so oh  suddenly this is a really good Lane to  play but I think she is still in a good  spot I still think you it's really  difficult to draft against a team that's  willing to three-way Flex the karma so  even though it did hit her I think she's  still in a good spot yeah I think last  week Karma was more banned than picked  so like we only saw it bot Lan but it  was banned and on almost every game so I  don't think Karma or Ezreal are  necessarily dead like when I look at the  win rate magnitude on like the stat  sites that you see online they didn't do  that much to move the needle down  especially if teams are practicing it  last week uh really quickly I do want to  we have the graphic now I want to pull  up the full patch notes to give like a  brief overview of the number of changes  and the number of items that were  actually hit because Turtle you already  mentioned that the itemization is going  to be changing things uh so you can see  like the system changes up at the top  right huge amounts of item changes uh  decent amount of Nerfs a lot of Buffs  some of the adjustments they say  adjustments where they're not really oh  my God the allow ones are Buffs guys I'm  sometimes it turns out to be a massive  buff like the maai one as well only hit  his win right by like 1% so I think 's  still going to be a support there one  thing I want to zero in on though you  can see up in the Buffs it goes ASO NY  and then  Pike luo so buio he won player of the  week last week so he was riding High uh  he he gains some followers on social  media by basically saying that he will  pick Pike if he gets to 10,000 oh he got  to 10,000 there it is and he had this to  say he's gonna pick Pike right you guys  so much for 10,000 followers on Twitter  hope you guys are excited to see Pike  this  weekend won't again hope you guys are  excited to see  bike these are the pike changes uh a lot  of line items I think overall it's a for  me a fairly minor buff the E damage  going up is much later in the game so I  don't think that's going to have of a  massive impact I'm actually just a  little curious Turtle as the coach shop  fire Bellion do you like that they're  maybe sleeping on Shopify a little bit  saying they're going to play Pike making  meane videos about it does that the task  at hand to beat Shopify Rebellion today  I mean I do hope they pick Pike you know  like I don't know if this Champion is  that good it did receive some Buffs the  w one's pretty big actually I think this  movement speed is actually pretty large  um but yeah I hope they do pick bike and  we can punish it all I'm saying was I  was watching some solo qu games I saw an  Alo Pike in Solo Q I'm just putting it  out there people are practicing it boo  trying to make the case to Nuke duck a  few supports just want to pick it  because it's fun and also the Buffs look  nice I mean he is really fun though it's  like really hard to kill and you can  just kind of walk wherever you want take  all the wards it's pretty enjoyable and  I will be unfollowing buio who doesn't  pick Pike because that was the deal he  said if he gets 10,000 followers he's  going to lock it in so he better this  week uh one final not on the patch Nico  is disabled due to visual bug it was  introduced in 14.3 we asked Leos because  we want to describe it they said we're  not telling you because we don't want  you doing solo que so just know that  we're not going to see Nico I wanted to  abuse the bug that's all we know we just  don't know uh in addition to the past  changes remember smolder is now enabled  in the LCS so let's check in with Yan  and masu for a rundown on  smolder hey guys it's Yan from Team  Liquid hey I'm masu Fest ADC and here's  some smolder  tips the very newb friendly Tech with  smolder these days is Comet manifold  bands absolute Focus scorge this is very  easy to get out of lane cuz in my  opinion smolder is a very scaling  Champion he's not very a lan heavy  dominant Champion where you want to like  brute force and duel people and fight  them I thought his laning phase should  be pretty weak but  then people discovered that you can just  start W and go com it and start  Ding and now I'm not so sure if his Lane  is weak so when the lane comes out like  this your main goal is to push the wave  as much as you can cuz your cool Downs  are very long and hit them as well as  you can so let's say they're here then  you want to W here if they're like here  you want to move a little bit and push  like this but in this case you push like  that and then you have a really decent  wave player so you can just do this and  because of how wide it is and how like  hard it is to miss you're basically  guaranteed to hit like somebody in Lane  which gives you a stack and keep in mind  you don't in my opinion you don't want  to auto trade that much because you  don't have like  a high ad with this there's always one  secret mechanic that people fail to  recognize like one very small very very  small one like a lot of people will use  this is like you can like glitch out of  the wall  anytime like let's say I'm hovering this  wall you can like keep glitching back  and forth towards the  end so you can like utilize how much  you're actually hitting them here like  one two and then at the end cuz it  actually ended here you know I try to  like see their numbers in game see how  strong they actually are early game how  hard do they scale into that game and  how easy is it to transition I think the  damage is very strong but I don't like  that it will lose a lot of Duss I think  how much his does was pretty surprising  at first because if you hit the center  at like level six it does close to like  300 damage I think the ultimate is very  strong like look how far it goes  mom these are my thoughts thanks for  watching smolder are we going to see  smolder that's kind of all chat wants we  will for sure see smolder for sure for  sure you're  guaranteeing Insanity gonna I do have  scam  LS um I mean again it is fearless draft  so obviously certain things get banned  out but we did see uh a bunch of smolder  in the NAC  yesterday um specifically smolder mid  seemed to end up being more successful  than smolder bot of like the sample size  um but teams were more than willing to  lock it in because once you hit 225  Stacks you actually just take over the  game yeah and when I was looking at some  of just the solo qu data uh there are a  lot of optimizations with the champion  like being able to know the damage of  your queue to stack faster is a  massively important optimization so  depending on your your ELO so like it  basically the highest Winer was Diamond  then Emerald then gold then silver in  terms of how good you are at smolder so  even the diamond I saw is already up  over 50% for a new Champion which to me  is like all right then like we're we're  almost certainly going to see it once I  once I see that I personally don't know  all the optimizations yet but what were  you going to say yeah I was about to say  cuz like with the the filming that we  had right there was actually it was last  week last week when it just released EX  so I'm sure their opinions have changed  on this one even to the point of like  the Rune changes like for me I I saw PTA  as a pretty nice Rune because Q procs  PTA at least it has one single proc on  it so you can Auto q auto and you can  get the PTA proc instantly so like  what's your experiences off of plays and  SC um after playing smaller myself too I  think the meteor build is just more op  just because when you land that first W  in Lane it's just like 170 damage and  it's near impossible to miss like w it's  just you're a noob if you're missing it  I'm sorry but but it's just easy to land  and if you hit Champions you get a stack  yeah you get a stack too so that's a  strong part I see a lot of people doing  like um three points in W and the Max  and q y so that's uh pretty popular  right now because one thing I did learn  and I'm sure everyone probably knows  this by now but once your three points W  and you have 25 stacks of Q you w the  back wave Q once you get three stacks  every single time so you push fast you  get Stacks fast uh Emily you mentioned  that Poss I'm pretty sure you can do the  same thing cuz like we were watching LEC  earlier we like whoa Senna got a lot of  souls off the MIT basically I'm pretty  sure each of those counts as a stack  yeah the little baby tiny kugs all give  you a stack as well so you can go kill  kugs and get like eight or 10 but at the  end of the day like it's like 20 minutes  until you're at 225 Stacks so it's  really hard like when do you fight no I  think like at least with the scrims I've  been watching too it takes around like  25 26 minutes to get like fully stacked  too and there's a lot of action so when  you get pulled away from you know  farming the creeps it could be how weak  are you before 26 I personally think  it's a pretty weak Champion it's like it  specializes in like kind of like Zone  controlling and just getting like a good  ultimate mm man it's GNA be I I think  Fleet is decent but I the comic build  makes sense yeah I don't know if Fleet  St maybe I need to play it's like  sustain it's just like depending on how  how rough you think the laning phase is  going to be do you think it's going to  go any other lane because uh you're  right about there being a lot of people  trying mid lane I actually when I was  watching and doing a lot of research I  was like watching Nemesis and he thinks  it's broken but also he's just playing  it a lot through mid sure um so it's  interesting to know that it's just it  can be used as a flex pick and I think  that will teeter it over to being abused  in uh competitive if people are willing  to flex it as as much as they uh think  it's good when I was checking the stats  highest solo K win rate was bought and  then it was about 3% lower in mid and in  top yeah um but Loro has been streaming  it a lot in top against like Melee  matchups and he's like oh you get get to  scale for free  and he's like he's still pretty bad at  it like if you watch him in team fights  he's just running he knows he is like  he's running around doing dumb things  just kind of having fun and he's still  actually finding a decent amount of  success because a lot of those games get  Derpy he has two and 25 stacks and it's  like he accidentally kills people like  once you get to 225 you just press it  does so it the spray is so wide I hope  we see it so we can see once you get to  225 because the difference and the  amount of damage do is just insanee yeah  I think we should have like a counter to  see who's getting it the fastest  to take over a Fast Five category May  okay uh let's check out the standings as  we move in to the second half of the  spring split regular season fly Quest  two games clear of the pack at six and  one we got a lot of four and three teams  Immortals three and four three games out  of first that's one more game out of  first and then last week and Shop fine  dig in seventh place that's your one ITT  so far today you always have to mention  Al is doing because a lot of people  thought they're going to be last and  look they're not last anyway schedule  today uh they could be last if things  don't go well because they play up  against dignitas in game two obviously  we got the championship rematch once  again energy versus Cloud9 in game one  Turtle will be joining the cast for that  one so definitely check it out and shop  fire Rebellion versus fly Quest who I  really curious to see who wild turtle  picked in that game but we'll see that  at the end of the waiting room so the  top story though yeah last week as we  saw from the standings there is there's  this like super team I heard we had like  a super team in the LCS I heard a little  I heard there were Cloud Nine yeah yeah  um but first I messed up the toss we got  to take a look what we've got on Deck  this  week  smolder smolder smolder smolder smolder  smolder smolder smolder smolder smolder  yeah smolder  smold smold guys guys guys guys guys  stop okay  smolder oh  smaller good point yeah yeah makes sense  yeah  Mom we're getting into the second half  of the round robin the biggest shocker  we have is cloud n being fifth Castle  coming around from the side blabber and  fudge into the back line mudget here in  the front he's not going to be taken  down just yet his castle kills blabber  fud's dropping low JoJo's dropping lower  oh they got him Immortals are crushing  Cloud are absolutely steam rolling of  its five dead B crumbling T the base and  had Cloud Nine their fourth straight  loss I'll just say it's C9 oh yeah so  Banger yeah like a little rough for them  for sure they're a little bit too lost  in this sa on draft and they're not  actually working as a unit unit to like  get wins they're just playing their own  Champions and hoping the game works out  after this game maybe he should just  stick to fortnite  so fly Quest they're loving it man their  jerseys are like the holographic Pokemon  card and these guys are charizarding the  league right now five and one has masu  is going to have to flash out of there  there's the heartbreaker from XU XU  trying to finish him off but masu is  King out masu is still alive and on the  other side it's Jensen taking over the  fight Berserker Under Pressure having a  flash away aio's ready to follow  berserker's barely hanging on but he  gets buried underneath the anchor  Berserker and Vulcan dying in the 2v2  masu makes sure he gets some bow here  comes the damage and oh the ulti by n  pops up the kalista and he gets taken  down a being pushed back and the emperor  divide multiplies the kills and it's a  triple heading on over to masu fly Quest  our number one team in the  LCS 2024 looking to be their  year hello and welcome back uh I am  going to start cuz we're going to kind  of go around the table here at the LCS  lounge and talk about what's going on  with C9 uh so I pick draft because it's  the thing that everyone is talking about  it's a thing that everyone is always  talking about these are a few of their  team comps in wins I think this nrg1  right off the bat the last time these  two teams faced they're going to face  each other again today is kind of the  platonic ideal of what this C9 team can  do with flabber on a carry uh JoJo  holding mid you have uh a pushing varis  and then maybe fudge doesn't like it but  uh he was one of the best udar players  in terms of understanding what to proxy  when to get to the rest of the team um  they also had a really nice nocturn and  Oriana combination there um and then  we're going to go team comps and losses  cuz that's actually what everyone wants  to talk about yep um this one I actually  will defend the VIN mid this was  into uh the Scion as my sleeves always  troll me here um but I think the big  thing with a lot of these compositions  is that it comes down to execution so  obviously they had a botlan play with  these two that went not so great in that  draft and then I think think the one  that everyone is kind of talking about  because with C9 IMT I actually thought  it was because IMT very smartly  picked  Ezreal and Bard mhm into this Lane um  and I actually thought that was a really  nice as well as the ivern was just  constantly negating whatever trist  wanted to do in mid um so that's more of  an execution and then the big thing here  is I think everyone kind of finds this  draft as the most egregious one and for  me it's actually not about the Lucian or  the Milo it's about how this draft Works  into what TL had which was a massive  range Advantage with  zigs  here um so I think like for me it's less  about these drafts in a vacuum and a lot  more about execution and then also what  they are picking them into because in  the TL thing even if you are giving that  draft the benefit doubt and you're like  we have players that can execute this I  think it's a lot more difficult to  execute than what TL had and I think for  me a lot of the clues for why they have  struggled on stage showed up in early  weeks and I I'm not surprised that this  ended up happening the way it did so  let's just let's just go back a little  bit and look at their goal graphs in  their wins and their losses they're very  onedimensional games right like  everything in the wins is up and to the  right and the majority of the things in  the losses are down and to the right uh  because this one Immortals game they  just ended up getting outscaled and that  was like probably their most competitive  game but what I mean what I mean to show  here is that they're very one  dimensional games they started off very  well in the first three games they lost  the last four and I think the drafts are  one part of it because they're picking  highly early game you're going to run  over a team type drafts and that worked  for three games but when you make  mistakes with that it goes very poorly  so really quickly I have one example of  just like just to remind people here's  one where it worked out well right so  their their first game against 100  thieves a gank in the Top Lane against  sniper they get a 2v2 double kill and  then right afterwards as you can see  they even chunk out quidd and like you  can actually just straight up win a game  off of a play like this and it's  basically fudge frows the lane in the  right spot L blabber knew they were  winning the 2v2 they kind of just hands  diffed the opponents but this is like a  2,000 gold swing as well as about half  level on everyone but this also had the  bad side of it one example was bot Lane  against fly Quest this happened last  week it got completely blown open  because buio landed the nice hook onto  Berserker Berserker was in too  aggressive of a spot they killed both of  them they ran it back they killed both  of them again and then because they  don't have that many tools  they ended up just getting snowballed  out of the game so the long-winded way  of saying this is I roughly went through  all seven of their games and tried to  see what their Tendencies were and this  isn't going to be 100% accurate because  this was just my opinion but to me they  had better scaling in one of seven games  they had equal scaling in one of the  games which is why I have 1.5 I thought  they picked pushing Lanes in 17 of 21  possible pushing Lanes which is  ridiculous and the hands definition  would be where did I think they straight  out outplayed or got outplayed and this  one would be too low for the amount of  talent they have on this team because  when you're picking these win Lane comps  you actually need to consistently hands  stiff the other team to be able to get  wins so they're not picking themselves  tools I think it's because they're  running over people in scrims they're  not getting the same leads on stage and  that's why we're in this current  predicament pick it back up what you  guys have said about the ex of theirs  you mentioned of course their bad plays  that happen another thing that I would  mention is also just the bot bot Lane  dive that they had against chai overall  so the play that I wanted to show for us  un as I'll get that going here oh sorry  I believe your mic died Raz so he's been  talking to us I promise but now he's got  a hot mic okay so just piggy backing off  the bad place for the both of you guys  the bot dive on against sh Rebellion and  then on top of that what you mentioned  the 2v2 this is another example the most  recent example versus Team Liquid with  they're going up against a rro  play a r play can you guys hear me at  the time I'll just keep going so we just  roll this here as we just roll this here  the mistake has already been made here  as you look at the mini map We Have Eyes  On uder on midwave and as you can  already see both APA and umpty are  challenging JoJo Pion in blabber on the  rift H so a mistake has already been  made when both Vulcan and Berserker are  opening up on core JJ and split  themselves the TP is coming in from Nar  but he's going to be here as you can  see so the ideal play for Berserker  Vulcan and JoJo Pion are to walk up so  he's able to participate in the play  it's going to be difficult for impact to  even come in he has to walk through the  Nar to make it happen and as I clear the  screen and just show you what ends up  happening they walk away from the Nar  easier access from Impact to be able to  just Maul uh the backline of Cloud9 and  as you can tell fudge comes into the  play too late so first thing that I  wanted to focus on is if you're  committing to the rift H and you're man  down you must commit as a team and walk  away as a unit but if you're going to  take the fight you have to involve fudge  in the play and we've seen it in  basically every game where botches so  those are things that we need to look at  when they go into this game which is as  simple as execution all right we're  going to be sending it to stage in a  minute but first let's check out the  predictions wild turtle you can go up  there because you got to get ready to  cast oh yeah yeah but let's let's check  out the predictions for today all of us  say C9 is going to bounce back let's go  wow we are stand by team Discord with a  1% Edge for energy in this game one but  the uh the Cloud9 Faith runs strong here  apparently and wild turtle could not go  against his team hey respect to the  Discord for actually going for NRG it's  a 51% so a bit after party after the  games today so make sure you here at the  lounge let's send it up to the casters  to get in to game one  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  ladies and G gentlemen welcome back to  the LCS here in Spring  2024 a happy Lunar New Year to all y'all  we are about to have some more fun here  it's Saturday we're kicking off the  second round robin of this split and  we're doing it with another rematch  energy versus C9 I'm captain flowers  here with Kobe and wild turtle we got  the rain and Champs looking to stand  tall in a rematch against that super  team now in freef Fall after that dig  and Immortals are going head to-head in  a battle to climb the standings in this  split where anybody can take down  anybody game number three of the day is  going to see the battle in the Top Lane  with the new generation of Na Talent  squaring up against the old guard of the  LCS as longtime Rivals 100 thieves and  Team Liquid throw down finally we're  going to wrap it all up with the mad  scientist at the LCS having to cook up  something truly special if they're going  to take down one of the strongest teams  in the league for Shopify versus fly  Quest I'm flowers that's Kobe this is  Turtle Gentlemen let's do it let's let's  do it and a happy delayed birthday  yesterday was wild turtles birthday  happy birthday happy birthday buddy  present I got you a cast with me and  flowers nice yeah yeah yeah and  hopefully these guys are going to bring  you some top level gameplay here for  this remember the first time that we saw  these two teams go head to-head to kick  off the split it was pretty one-sided  and it was one-sided Cloud n's way yeah  I want see n to win just because you  know uh I also was talking to Cloud9  members cuz were just in makeup at the  same time as me and I was going over  patch notes and I was like oh they love  Zer and Berserker was like we're going  to win World his favorite Champion so  fingers crossed you know maybe they'll  get their hands on Zer or maybe the  smolder as well smolder today yeah I  think so I I feel like it uh the scaling  is so good because you can get to your  225 Stacks uh pretty early in the game  at least by 20 minutes most people have  been able to do it yeah we did see uh  last week as well you know a tiny bit of  darus coming out bipo trying his hand at  it so maybe it's made its way through  the scrims I don't know well still one  ban to go on Cloud9 side they could just  take that off the table if they want to  I feel like if energy is going to ban  out Darius they're kind of saying yeah  we will'll slam uder if you don't ban it  but C9 going to focus on the Twisted  Fate instead so Twisted Fate Ash Iver  banned out by C9 energy getting rid of  the Tristana the ory and the  Darius DLo with the classic hover of  auction keeping us in suspense for the  first pick and it it is that Udo  priority who could have guessed yo we  also looked at the you know the CL in  the Cloud9 victories two of the three  games were fudge on the uder it's just a  champion that is so useful uh pushing up  into enemy jungle and taking over  territory but now we're looking we're  still have this magnifying glass on the  bottom Lane and I feel like Cloud9 have  their have their pick here for  Berserker all right do they go ahead and  lock in this Varys yes they they will  okay this is something that I was kind  of hoping to see some of it's not Lucian  for C9 they definitely had some rough  performances on that they're going to  put Berserker back on the varas what is  Vulcan going to play next to him to  ensure some 2v2 success here that's what  I'm  wondering well looks like they might be  going for the answer into the uder first  to me I haven't been a huge fan of the  Cante into the udar but there are a lot  of magic resist first items you can rush  now Hollow Radiance helps you with wave  clear and uh is decent magic resist uh  for the for the Phoenix form so a lot of  people have been going that route and  just having Cante as the answer for  later all right let's see here hey since  we have our pre-recorded drafts we get  the Cloud9 chance during uh they just  got out of their practice tools everyone  was practicing up a couple of special  matchups here and getting the hype ready  so we've got the Senna locked in here  for energy FBI and who he not shy at all  about playing the ca Tom kup it's a  draft where they feel like it's a good  pick to go with let's see if they want  to go ahead and lock in that second half  or if they have something even spicier  plan to pair with the Senna yep I  wouldn't be surprised at all there it is  TK locked in how do you feel about Senna  TK TK Lanes compared to traditional ones  well Sen's got like a new build right  now she doesn't go like the support item  anymore like as the first item so she's  probably going to start the dblade and  start farming a little bit and  potentially buying the uh support item  on the first base but okay I've seen it  being skipped overall too so we'll  see if you were playing for Cloud9 um  what would you want to pair with  berserker's Varys into a senate Tom  kench that lane has so much healing yeah  it's a little bit difficult to find a  good support I think milia would be a  decent one maybe potentially Rada as  well so that's probably what I would go  for yeah Rada definitely has a good  counter  Milo well now they might also want some  engage yeah also important to keep an  eye on what's going to get banned out  the H banned out by C9 thinking okay  maybe they've got some sort of uh some  tech cooking up against the azir here in  mid lane the azir was locked in before  we got to the second half of the band so  we'll see what energy wants to look at  here the Oriana remember was already  banned out in the first half of the  draft they definitely needs you know  some good uh DPS Mage here for pal Fox I  know that Tia got buffed on this patch  both po Fox and contracts are big Tia  players so it could be a big Flex pick  for them uh jungle SL mid lane and toia  is very commonly a pick into the azir  azir has a lot of answers now since it's  the most picked Champion but the Tia  definitely is an option  there they might take the corki but  corki just got Nerf recently so yeah  there's a potential for that the  interaction between eclipse and  malignants being removed so you don't  just automatically get the get the proc  with a single rocket aali ban out Karma  who's now a multilex pick band out Quay  that can often be played in mid lane  sometimes other places but you mostly  see a mid banned out lots of mid Focus  but the final one will be that meio one  of the options you were talking about  that could be a good pairing with the  veras the ranata is still there we'll  see if C9 wants to go for that they  still have to pick both that support and  Jungle which one are they going to leave  for last my guess would be  support counter pick definitely has a  lot more value there but we're already  seeing the whole bottom Lane here with  the uh Senate TK so they lock it in wow  now B has been going with this super  tanky build too so it's one of the most  annoying supports for the rest of the  map right now um getting out there and  we'll see if ven Vulcan can actually  split up his time and try and uh try and  help out with the grubs try and help out  blabber in controlling the rest of the  map early  on energy were one of the classic combos  of having pow Fox on a kill oriented  Mage when you combine it with the vi and  that's the one I was talking about the  Tia buff coming in hot I know both these  players love this champion and when you  have a VI guaranteed setup for the  seismic shove for TOA that's a a classic  kill combo for energy it's like let's  see we've been already seeing some picks  of this if C9 wants to go for it they  could lock it  in SNY little bit less exciting yeah I  hear audible Gro from the crowd brand  come on they wanted to burn it all down  bran did get some pretty substantial  they didn't complet like kill the  champion or anything but it did bring  him a lot more in line they slowed down  the clear a little bit with some of the  brand Nerfs on this patch and so blabber  going to go with another tank Cloud9  have not had great success with him on  tanks so far this season yeah they got  all their wins when he was on you know  DPS type of Champions but they are going  to have a very very beefy front line  especially if Vulcan also builds tanky  um you know Cloud9 with very much a two  threat comp position here so Turtle let  me ask you to seeing all 10 Champions  locked in which one of these drafts  would you rather be playing now I  personally would rather be playing on  energy side I just think it's much  easier to execute like the V into the  Tia combo is just very easy UD has pry I  think balling is going to have pry too  so it seems like they have two shoving  lanes and a TOA that can run to either I  I would give the early game to energy  right now the the comp I definitely  agree because I like having the you know  the ball in your court so to speak and  energy they're the ones that have a lot  of the options for proactive moves you  know UD your top side too should have  full control there so contrax and po Fox  are definitely set up in this game to be  the ones to make some early moves try  and get those those early kills and then  later on even if VI goes too deep you  have a Tom kench on your team to to sa  her as well so I feel like they they  have a really good way to execute on  team fights Cloud9 though obviously  really good scaling there with the a so  they also can't count out the air is  that what you're doing if you're Cloud n  cuz what I'm about to ask here is you  guys are giving me the whole movie  trailer for this energy protagonist  moment here what if you do with you're  C9 what do you do if you're trying to  stop this loss streak and respond to  this draft I think for C9 they just have  to get JoJo in like a comfortable  position to potentially push waves and  get the free Farm I think when aeri gets  one or two items he can definitely hold  on to the game for them I'm a little bit  worried for Cloud9 because in a lot of  their recent losses where this team is  kind of unexplicably begun to freef fall  they have had a lack of proactive plays  and in this game it seems like that  might be the case again of course they  do have Bard and they do have Sani who  who can make some action early so maybe  they'll be able to get something going  definitely need to have uh take a little  bit more control than they have so far  this uh this season though woo all right  let's get into it see what goes down  Cloud Nine trying to fight back after a  disastrous super week I believe we have  the numbers for how long it's been since  this team has lost five games in a row  2774 days that's uh 7 point something  years a very very long time but energy  have the opportunity to make that a  reality here today you guys have already  been talking about how you expect energy  to be able to control the early game and  C9 is going to have to find some sort of  response here cuz you can see their  upcoming schedule is not going to be  definitely does not get easier from here  they did win the first time this season  though versus energy the first game of  the entire split was a Cloud9 Victory um  back in the beginning when they were  still a super  team we'll see how super they're feeling  after this one I'm going to have a lot  of eyes on this bottom Lane in  particular Berserker and Vulcan when  Berserker throut a lot of last year the  year before was being talked about as  just the bar for mechanical excellence  in the ad carry role him and Vulcan  having some rough laning phases some  tough 2v tws last week is Do's just  trying to annoy these guys the awakened  glacial attack from uder is very  obnoxious blabber losing some extra HP  there as even though it was a 2V1  defense do can still trade pretty even  yeah the North American udir have been  really really good at this constantly uh  starting out to invade enemy jungle  getting them a little bit behind there's  some early bot action oh yeah who's  hungry but Vulcan can get away there we  go one last lick and stunn bom all right  Turtle Waka through the early stages  from the point of view from the senat  Tom kench well for them they just want  to like keep the wave push oh they're  going to go for an all in here too yeah  looks like a Berserker taken low Vulcan  even lower below 200 hp there on the  support as Energy's Duo of immediately  establishes  control yeah energy just has to maintain  this control now the lane is pretty much  over I don't see how bar be is going to  get back into this  one all right constant push on bottom  side s wani is pathing down towards  bottom and contract actually just did  his red quadrant and is coming for an  invade here okay let's see if he runs  into blabber what sort of jungle  violence we get here in this blue side  quadrant for C9 instead they may just  try to turn it into a dive the wave  about to crash into the turret Vulcan  and Berserker hitting level two  contracts coming in looks for the Vol  breaker and he breaks vulcan's jaw now  Berserker under the pressure next a  little bit more damage is required oh no  it's some go he plays coming out from  energy as who he just barely gets away  from the turret shot it ends up being a  one for one trade yeah contract just  need to back out and like reset the  tower Argo there oh Berserker he's about  to drop who he's going in what about the  tongue he flashes he misses oh it's frog  legs for dinner goodbye good night  Berserker gets paid and FBI drops again  energy I don't even know what the hell  that was  as DOA versus fudge continues with the 1  one in the top side but Do's fast enough  to get away it's a 3 to one game before  4 minutes well flowers we wanted we're  looking for Cloud9 to to bounce back and  have some early moves it actually is  fully reactive though it's not them  being proactive on the plays it's it's  energy kind of spoofing the dive here  now the first kill is perfect [ __ ] it's  just that when he goes for a little bit  more here back out yeah definitely uh  you either got to just commit to it and  and get the kill on Berserker under  Tower and sacrifice your life there  because they had the ward up by Blue  buff uh to see the path down from  blabber but then yeah once who he goes  off in for it it's very difficult to  redive unless you reset the tower aggro  so yeah that was a pretty Hasty play  from contract there and I think I love  the fact that you brought it up it was  reactive Kobe this is one of those ones  that energy they full force the whole  situation and now they're going to  suffer the consequences for it still  only about a 500 gold lead for C9 so not  like they lost massive minion waves or  anything off of that but energy now also  has the push mounting up again you can  see all of these minions piling up here  it'll be another big wave crashing into  the bot side turret top side is uder  being uder as you might expect tough to  Lane against him very very strong been  kind of the Premier go-to pick that  there's not really great answers into so  far nice Wombo Combo back in the mid  lane here JoJo tries to get away but  Pala Fox is ready to knock him down  blabber seea maybe there's an angle try  to get one back on Al Fox throws out the  W doesn't find a ton just a little under  contract but the burst power of Sani not  usually that scary blers coming in but  palifox barely gets away contrax and  palifox really see it how far they can  push this one blabber ends up forcing  the flash of the energy mid lane this  game's extremely high  action blabber is not done yet either he  wants to steal away the chickens  contract knows he's there but he's only  got 200 hp as the vi man he can't go  contest yeah blabber is a pretty beefy  pick here he got both of the early kills  who he wants to get something back  though going for the Abyssal dive but  blabber can just jump out of the way  Arctic Assault clears the distance so  nothing more to punish or catch here for  energy yeah but blabber getting two of  the early kills off the tower dive to  the early bomy Cinder means that he's  able to bully in get a little bit of  counter jungle back since contrax had  stolen away his kugs uh preemptively  before that fight even turned out maybe  this means they just used this priority  to start up the dragon blabber's going  to leash it out right now while Vulcan  and Berserker push up on this bottom  wave and they have JoJo pushing in mid  lane too so free dragon it's very  important for energy to get start  stacking the grubs as early as they can  this game because they have the U Top  should use that to their advantage so  You' just rather see grub pry over early  Drakes anything like that for energy  well for energy side yeah I think so get  that split pushing going a little bit  more value a little bit  easier now you can see a ward inside  that grub pit though placed down by C9  as they take the Drake so they can at  least be wary If energy is trying to do  those cross trades palifox level here on  Thea I always want to see firsta  ultimates result in some kind of a big  movement here it's similar to something  like a knockturn where it's long cool  down but you have so much presence from  somewhere else I want to see him affect  the other lanes with it JoJo with the  push right now Fox still looking since  JoJo had to use his uh Flash the last  time they got the kill on him too as  soon as contrax gets the level six I  think it's going to be a repeat contract  skank in mid lane no flash on the azir  ultimate into seismic shove look for the  kill combo again contracts if he's able  to get the grubs those things do give a  lot of experience this Grub's going to  be hard  La blabber having the edge with that  level six is a big difference maker but  he's just happy to start off with the  chicken Camp right now contract secures  the first grub moving on to number two  these are not going down exceptionally  quickly yeah but ud's got so much pry on  top side uh constantly pushing here is  able to make sure blabber will secure  the grubs for energy so on Turtles  checklist for energy okay nice they've  uh they've corrected the game from the  early dive should be able to get all  three oh they see s here yep oh going to  go all out fud just going to bring go  into a 2V1 before contracts can even  make it over I feel like man you can  never ever forget about where Cante is  in respect to the terrain or you're  going to end up in a spot like  that beautiful St there able to bring  him back into his own pocket next to his  jungler but here's the repeat gank uh  towards mid lane JoJo slides into Tower  no problem for him yeah he's not worried  about that one even even with the thumbs  up that's the yeah the gang's not going  to do anything okay see you later I'll  blow the E cool down c9's in a pretty  Prime position  now what do you want to see him do from  here they just need to maintain and make  sure Zer can push waves safely while he  has no flash right now all right so they  had a poll in chat who's going to bounce  back back from Super week cuz both these  teams had a little bit of a rough super  week Cloud9 obviously more of a rough  one but chat sided very slim margins for  energy okay if you're looking at it  right now Turtle which side are you on  game's still pretty  close I'm still on energy side I feel  like they still have the uh the strong  VI to Lea combo I just want to see it  happen well blabber right now just  making sure that he maintains presence  in the jungle trying to put down a  couple of control Wards just trying to  keep keep an eye on where this enemy  jungler is going to be stop contracts  from finding those ganks finding that  point and click guaranteed engage as  Dola goes to proxy yep UD doing UD  things he's got two turret plates  already on the top side of the map you  mentioned the grubs the extra pushing  power there extra gold value help out  with the splitting later on too but  Vulcan now out onto the map not quite  level six here yet for The Bard very  very close to get his ultimate for some  playmaking ah close doesn't count he's  immediately got to retreat as energy  sends in more men now JoJo retreating  back underneath the turret seismic shove  just barely not going to find him there  could have been in some serious danger  if it did but JoJo staying safe enough  for now the flash just about ready to go  again I believe does have the alul ready  to cast two as Vulcan is trying to again  rotate around be able to be there stop  any kind of play they're making but do  it carefully enough that he doesn't get  caught himself in the process contracts  on top of a control Ward just waiting to  see if C9 tries to force something he  can turn it around yeah everybody in the  game knows they got eyeballs for Jojo  flashes back up now for the azir though  so it makes it even scarier cont is in  trouble yeah contracts getting caught  there try to use the B breaker now turns  it right back around onto JoJo air but  the flash out of the way of the SI MC  shove means contracts is done C the  first kill as Vulcan gos the  timing yeah that part wasn't great but  the part before it was good for C9 yeah  we had timing misses on both sides cuz  po Fox was not ready to follow up on the  contract's ultimate so he didn't get the  seismic shove out of it either so there  was no counter kill for energy another  big one here for Cloud9 right that was  very well played by C9 they just had  everyone around mid cuz they knew that  that the action was going to be there  now energy will try to at least get  something back here on the bottom side  grab the turret plates both TPS used to  bring the midlaners back into their Lane  after the scuffle a single kill on both  of them only a couple of difference in  CS but one of the biggest differences  right now the nashor's tooth First full  item Spike completed for Jojo because  palifox stopped to grab the sorcerer  shoes instead of fully investing into  the one completed item so JoJo feeling  pretty strong right now but again  without that Flash without an ulti he's  got to be careful cuz V could always be  around energy bringing up extra players  as Vulcan goes on a magical journey  trying to get away where is energy going  to go who do they decide to chase  vulcan's your target for now Abyssal  dive coming in to throw him up energy  knocks him down palifox gets paid and  contract starts up the Drake honestly I  it looked a little bit like energy were  also having the same debate that you  were having while you're casting that  flowers like which one are they going to  where are they going to go well pal Fox  flashed uh towards JoJo but then they  end up getting the kill onto Vulcan  anyways so they do get the dragon they  don't get the chase down onto JoJo but  doas right back out onto the map and we  see blabbers currently on the mini map  on the grubs trying to make sure that  energy at the very least will not get  six and he wants to make sure that they  don't get five for the extra void mites  he doesn't have Smite though he used his  Smite on the first one I believe yeah  this could be a problem okay going to  get five here yeah it's four grubs  they're going to try to guarantee the  blabber can't steal away the last one a  TP is coming in energy might just have  to abandon it here JoJo gets stopped by  the unraveled Earth contracts and the  rest of energy cannot secure the fifth  grub C9 critically preventing the break  point preventing the void mites from  spawning as energy does not want to take  the fight any  further definitely like this play too  right afterwards they just teleport Dola  down to the bottom side but Cloud9 like  you said they stopped the critical five  grub point for that really annoying udar  split push slow it down a tiny bit uh  looks like doo is actually not going to  go for the turret plate on the bottom  side he just teleported down there just  to clear out one wave and get his reset  off to Backside here for fudge honestly  this the as the later the game goes it's  going to be really interesting watching  can JoJo actually  work through this kind of beefy front  line or is the vi plus TOA plus Senna  ultimate over the top combo going to be  enough to assassinate him basically  through all of this peel that they have  I think it would be much easier for C9  to play if they actually first engage  with the Sani and The Bard just so they  can navigate the fight easily cuz I  think if VI Lea goes first it's going to  be pretty hard for Jojo yeah definitely  very scary especially with the extra  damage of a senate ultimate coming over  the top yeah that 100% to zero always  always looks scary when when he's got a  Flash and blabber's definitely super  tanky right now on the Sani really  beefed up so him leading the charge  maybe if Vulcan is able to get one of  those big b ultimates to make it easy to  land the  followup could have some 3v3 action  breaking out here FBI and whoi want to  step up at least try to challenge  blabber they're going to steal away the  gro but at what cost whoi popping the  thick skin trying to get away in time as  JoJo's entrance is going to be blocked  off by Pala Fox but blabber has already  killed support who he's down and FBI  about to get knocked out Berserker takes  the kill and c9's up 7 to3 honestly I  feel like energy are their own worst  enemies the the biggest Cloud9 plays  feels like the defending on the tower  dive on bottom and then defending jungle  again here another big one for  Cloud9 honestly energy just needs to  calm it down a little bit around this  bottom Lane Turtle talk to me a little  bit about this situation as somebody  who's played in a professional game like  this you try to make a couple of plays  they end up backfiring how do you sort  of like reset and get yourself back in a  mind state to stop those sort of sort of  mistakes from continuing I think they  just have to take a deep breath and  recognize their win condition they  really need to get toia and VI involved  in these plays and I don't think they  are right now cont tracks well V's  getting involved in a play but is it the  play he wants JoJo's getting locked down  here with a star beautifully done  contracts palifox and FBI have already  found the enemy mid laner but can they  get anymore flabber with a flashback  away try to get underneath the tier one  turret as P Fox tries to cut him off  here with the Weaver's wall FBI needs a  couple more shots but who he's tongue  ain't going to find the mark shut down  back over to Senna still as Berserker  fully Retreats and Vulcan is left to the  graveyard contracts and FBI both coming  right back around piercing Darkness  finds him and tof fox goes on the  Rampage energy get three action packed I  love watching Energy play cuz even after  they fail on the first invade bottom  side then they get right back to it  another fight another Victory and  they're able to swing the gold lead  right back in their favor Cloud9 with  the teleport top for Jojo means that  they should be able to at least get a  tower in the aftermath though okay so C9  will pick this up we talk about  sometimes as gold leads being pendulums  that swing back and forth this one feels  like a yo-yo we're just throwing that  thing out and back and out and back this  game is pretty wild with 13 kills at 16  minutes still under 1,000 gold  separating the two teams you can see on  this gra here the greatest distance that  it was was 1674 in the favor of C9  before that thre Man play that happened  at the hands of energy in the bottom  Lane we do have the heral alive on the  map it's going to be there for another 3  minutes or so still and I don't think  we're going to just see it expire this  game Cloud9 putting a lot of players in  the topside  River all right I don't think it's going  to stop anytime soon flowers cuz we got  a dragon coming up and energy grabbing  the Scuttle crab Vision First they've  got plenty of wards here looking out for  the Cloud9 members coming to try and  check too nice job there popping the  blast cone got the ghost too yeah fudge  has to walk away from that one remember  that fudge is entirely Mr right now  first item is just a kanic Rooker yes he  has tabies but that's not worth a ton on  its own as blabber and the rest of C9  they see at least two players from the  enemy team in the bottom River they're  going to use the opportunities to secure  this heral for themselves while Energy's  got three guys working on the Drake they  should be able to grab that so a cross  map trade in the object jectives c9's  going to look to try to grab some value  here from the eye of the  heral honestly them opting for Rift tril  and trying to get uh through that some  of this outer Tower gold here for either  the azir or the Varys and and just  buffing up these DPS Champs the two  carry uh comp from Cloud9 with both of  them being Auto attack based here I feel  like this is definitely setting  themselves up for the path to victory  for Cloud9 they just have to be able to  execute on this team fight and actually  keep those two carries alive when Jojo  and Berserker have flash it is  definitely playable for Cloud9 when they  do not have flash the energy dive is so  scary though that that combo with by  guaranteeing the setup for POW Fox one  of those two carries is definitely going  to get  annihilated I think for Vulcan he just  has to look out for his ulti onto the um  Tia when by Altis his air so you block  the Tia stop the follow up stop the  combo and then azir's ready to fire back  everybody else works together and kills  by once she Dives in C9 staying together  staying grouped up they have to have  recognized how energy is trending  towards mistakes in this game if you're  grouped up if you can punish those  energy can just gift you the game but  energy with four kills on Pala Fox all  my eyes are on this Tia to see if he can  get the carry done to see if he can step  up and continue making the types of  plays that can deliver them the Dub here  against Cloud9 get revenge for that  first game of the split last month  energy with control over the mid lane  going to push things up here FBI  continuing to harvest those Souls desna  up to 76 18 and a half minutes into the  game as energy controls the bottom side  River yeah honestly they're just  cleaning out more territory where they  can look for picks they've got a lot of  options here with uh with the Tia ult  ready for po Fox to cut people off but  Cloud9 doing their Duty here grouping up  again in mid lane using that Rift Trail  trying to get this outer Tower money  like we're looking for there we go okay  summoned up going for it turret's  already down but now where's the fight  going to go contracts here at the very  front he's going to be Gob by who he to  stay alive DOA wanted an angle he wanted  a pins or attack but the suis summoned  up to make sure that C9 had a banner to  Rally around Dola doesn't have an  entrance into the fight energy still  trying to just regain control over the  mid lane on their side of the map the  sunis slowly Bleeding Out FBI and pal  fox trying to keep fudge away as he  steps forward to establish some vision  control for down in the brush next to  the Raptors but the chickens are being  led on a long journey away from their  home okay they're finally going to reset  and the vision gets cleared yeah both  blabber and fudge are really good for  face checking right now uh trying to get  into enemy jungle push their their  territory forward but that's basically  the expected value of the objective  trade that they saw earlier you know  when you go for that Rift Trail You're  Expecting that's going to be your mid  turret basically guaranteed with that  one Cloud9 do a good job defending their  carries um staying strong here in the  five person setup c9's in a really solid  position right now for this game I think  they're just waiting on berserker's  second item and they should be good to  start baring as  well blade of the ruin King already done  for him as long as he's protected well  enough to get those Auto attacks off  this guy's going to hurt a lot but I'm  curious if energy again maybe if you  can't find JoJo with that VI toia combo  you just turn it on Berserker blow him  up instead vulcan's really going to need  to be paying attention here with this  Bard like you already talked about about  Turtle as soon as you see VI going in  you got to stop the  followup defensive B ulti is going to be  key also worth noting JoJo is going for  the Lich Bane second here cuz he's got  the early Sheen nice little price  reduction on the component item this  patch as well 100 gold off of Sheen um  really really just uh efficient  component now with the ability haste and  the proc that it's going to give you but  it does mean he's not going to have the  LeAndre for the team fight so isn't  going to have the LeAndre for the Tom  kench the vi or the udar but he does  have really good burst damage uh  especially with that auto attack coming  out so quickly now with the new Lich  Bane I do believe the lichbane had the  base ad ratio nerfed on it a little bit  with this patch to just knocked down  ever so slightly yep from 100 down to 75  for a lot of Mage Champions it's not  super impactful just because most of  it's coming from your AP ratio anyway  but still something to be cognizant of  as the gold is tied dead even between  these two teams the Drake is spawning in  a little bit over 30 seconds and they  made the call for po Fox to push out top  side First Energy again trying to play  the map here look at the mini map  they've got bot and top both pushing for  themselves Dragon coming up shortly here  so they've got their side waves correct  they also have the teleport and the ulti  ready for  palifox maybe they can get that top  Tower before Dragon spawns but Cloud9  stays strong you mentioned it multiple  times but sticking as five with those  defensive ultis ready trying to stand  strong and keep Berserker and JoJo safe  seems like energy feels weaker right now  so they're just going to give this  Dragon they don't even want to fight it  exactly they're just going to surrender  it C9 will grab their second Drake of  the game you can see the Crypt Bloom  completed here for palifox he went ahead  Got The Verdant barrier second which I  really liked I think the value of the  spell shield was pretty high against the  composition drafted by C9 but then  recognizing hey they have two massive  meatballs one of which just rushed kanik  Rooker he needs to be able to penetrate  through that magic resistance as Do's  going to see if there's an  anglex could join okay oo I think energy  has to look for good picks on the side  Lanes now let's see it Energy's coming  in JoJo trying to get away contracts  looking for the chance to go in flashes  in for the Alti over the top comes Senna  but JoJo gets out seismic shove ain't  going to find him and energy could not  get the combo executed correctly C9 gets  their mid laner away small little  Windows there in between the timing K  Fox get here now yeah they're just going  to start it up C9 going for this  recognizing hey that was a lot of  resources that's sen ult that's TOA ult  that's VI that's a lot from the tank of  energy and C9 is burning the baron down  they've already got it below 6K below 5K  down to 4K do coming in trying to stop  him but C9 wants to burn it blabber  secures the barar and as fudge tries to  dive into the middle of everybody and  contracts is controlled JoJo's barely  getting away aist will dive on the four  fud is stuck back in the pin as do tries  to tear him up and FBI's grab it a shut  down energy need to find more BL with a  flash out trying to get himself back to  the base while still wearing the purple  he throws out the W but he gets slowed  down by the Tongue FBI still trying to  pursue him still trying to get all the  way there but blabber escapes underneath  the turret it is Baron over to C9 but at  the cost of a two for one trade oh  no into a pause such a good uh call here  from Cloud9 though as soon as there's no  VI ultimate and even though JoJo traded  his flash for contract's Flash they know  they have so much Barren burning power  with azir plus the two item Varys with  the buffed up by the way rageblade now  on Varys melting right through that  Baron so they did get it just in time  even though energy get there and get a  two for one trade just getting plus one  in kills Cloud9 will be very happy  because they also kept three Baron Buffs  to push afterwards  with what a game man this one's turning  into quite the Banger compared to like I  said the first time these two teams  played this split it didn't feel  particularly close it didn't feel like  it was could have gone either way but  this one is 24 minutes in two Drakes  each neither side having enough grubs to  spawn the void mites kills are tied gold  right next to each other it could still  go either way so easy it definitely  could I got an update the pauses for  Berserker he had some issue with his  keyboard another peripheral pause  flowers I'm uh I'm not too H not too  happy with these keyboard issues maybe  we need to we need to inspect them  ourselves  keyboards Turtle has never paused for a  keyboard issue I don't think I have  actually yeah look at this guy you're  one of the longest standing players we  got a pagota pause going on yeah we got  can we get some of those up here yeah  maybe that's the trick we bring  up oh oh man all right well hopefully  we'll be able to get back in here soon  whatever is wrong with yeah they just  really burned the Nash they had the Zer  and then the Varys with the two  core uh honestly from from the energy  side now it it does feel like it's  starting to get a bit difficult because  Cloud9 keep defending the these attempts  at JoJo's life um Berserker doesn't have  ghost he does have flash maybe they go  for the kill onto the onto the vars okay  we're going to get a replay of the last  flight okay okay  yay all right so they're burning down  really good  DPS contract is pretty far so there's no  hope of a steal but contracts look at  him charging his VQ and he goes straight  for the play again onto um JoJo pow Fox  set him up it was a beautiful Tia combo  actually into viq so is pow Fox doing  the work getting JoJo into range and  that's that's the only reason that they  even got the two kills yeah who he just  landed a fourman W yeah the the Abyssal  dive onto four there was crazy cuz if he  doesn't go over the wall I'm pretty sure  that contracts can't hit JoJo again and  JoJo just walks away with 150 HP still  remaining so really nicely done to save  that here you kind of seeing it going  down live the over the shoulder cam from  JoJo yeah now we're looking at a case  where it does start to get really  difficult um for energy here considering  how much gold Cloud9 have gotten on  their air on their Varys pow Fox though  is still really fed to Leah uh and he  does have nine Stacks dark seal you  mentioned that he just finishes CIT  Bloom and he should be able to finish  you know a banshees Veil next or  something unless he was just wants to  sit on the vernant barrier since they  did buff that component as well but  maybe maybe it's a like upgrade to Medi  angle yeah and really go for it I mean  if you fully stack your dark seel and  it's 10 Stacks the the value of  upgrading into Medi is so  big but then I mean if you upgrade it  and you immediately don't die lose all  10 pages where' your value go where'  your value go okay I can I can respect  it though if you feel like okay the game  starting to we got win we got to make  big plays I'm the only one who can do it  sure maybe but then again you're going  to get flamed if you die if you lose the  pages Let's see we don't have uh don't  have any additional updates right now we  do I'm curious the same way that you are  Kobe is he going to just go ahead and  complete the Banshees Veil or also do  you just hit something you know Magi  death cap whatever just something turbo  damage focused to try to guarantee that  you get that instant burst cuz the  biggest issue for me throughout this  game for energy has just been the  coordination hasn't felt right whether  it was the early dive where okay  contracts is going back in but it looked  like we probably should have all just  walked away are all committed when they  tried to make the pick on jojo in the  jungle but he just barely gets out even  back in mid lane when there's there's  that slight delay on the follow-up of  the contract salty there's just a little  bit that's not quite there for energy  this game all I got an update we're  we're rushing a new keyboard over now  okay emergency substitute keyboard David  has the keyboard chat send your energy  to David running it over as quickly as  possible now yeah we're back into the  game that was really fast they must have  sent a lot of energy yeah that was a  bunch okay we're back into the game now  24 minutes in slight gold lead for  energy but you would expect that to  swing back into the favor of C9 since  like you pointed out Kobe they still  have the baron on multiple  players okay got to refocus after the  pause that was the biggest thing even  blabber himself was talking about last  time when Cloud n had the big pause he  lost Focus we'll see if uh honestly it's  not too bad if a saidani this fed  actually loses Focus he's so tanky and  he's got the Regeneration from his  warmog so Cloud9 have the ability with  Baron buff to push up multiple Lanes and  they have really good face Checkers here  in blabber and fudge they're going to  push out mid and then rotate basically  everybody over yeah having The Bard  makes it so much nicer for your side a  lot uh a lot more options here with  those tunnels General observation about  the map state to hold on tp's coming in  energy having a disengage now as blabber  misses the Sani Al chains of corruption  also missed C9 saw what looked like  maybe an angle but they cannot execute  successfully so energy just walks off  from that one worth pointing out c9's  got this Baron buff for a little bit  over another minute once it expires  it'll be about 60 seconds from then  until the Drake so C9 does have the  opportunity to set up the rift for an  advantageous position remember with both  teams already at two Dres a piece the  next one's going to be sole point for  someone who he jumps in the abys will  die but nobody else is close enough to  do a lot especially not with fudge being  the only one here on the front line even  though cloud n uh you know missed the  Sani Al from good a Maneuvers from whoi  and then he flashes the bar Cloud9 still  get an isolated outer turret for Jojo  for this azir that is working on death  cap which scals so well considering you  added the lichbane with another AP ratio  onto him so JoJo approaching Three core  for Jojo and for Berserker energy  they've got to start feeling the  pressure here they're they they might  start feeling a little desperate we  might see another one of these super  deep aggro plays from them contract has  flash po fox has  flash they they really need to make good  on one of those picks and try and get  someone from Cloud9 isolated get some of  those key Summoner spells off of the  Cloud9 carries cuz if those two are are  just safe the air and the Varys right  now will demolish you well Baron has  faded gentlemen it is 60 seconds until  the Drake spawns we don't really see a  whole lot happening in that botside  river right now there is is currently  energy Vision controlling it but a  couple of Cloud9 Wards on the back side  of the pit to also see if energy is  trying to make more of an entry into  that part of the ra part of the rift  excuse me right now as C9 is more  focused on the top side they've got all  five players either in mid or in that  topside River area as JoJo is set up to  push Top Lane they seem really content  with farming right now on the air yeah  look at this H how nice is it to have  two people shadowing blabber and Vulcan  the two babysitters to come watch JoJo  Farm on the Sid Lanes they're like  please just eat up a little bit more  money here I'm surprised they didn't  want oh he's going he's going for zonas  instead of the death cap here it's  pretty smart versus the vi I think yeah  it's their only win condition he got the  Seeker so he has an active already for a  stopwatch to deny that Cloud9 play  really smart or deny that energy play  Cloud9 really smart fight might break  out here yeah we got energy on the  approach a t P coming into the mid lane  from palifox who he's going to be caught  by the B Al but he's the only Target now  he's got to try to tank it up S Al over  the top who he's still about half HP  fudge coming in looking to complete the  dive as Berserker goes on the Rampage go  is thrown back into the team all out  goes fudge all in goes contract but he's  one5 he ain't alive everybody died it's  SE nine three for nothing there you go  right into their hands they have scaled  Cloud n  protect and they collect  Dragon number three that was good yeah  that was smooth that was slick yeah I'm  pretty sure once the Varys also gets a  stopwatch this game should be over yeah  really good immediately immediately used  the seeker's arm guard right after  purchasing but honestly they already had  the advantage in the team fight here you  know where they're getting so much free  damage on is just too far he TP to the  mid Tower he just wasn't close enough  for this fight yeah so they get a really  big head start in the health bars here  lots of free damage onto that energy  front front line and then uh yeah it was  all lost this game is looking really  hard for energy  now Cloud n currently in the process of  bouncing back from their super weak  losses here they have been able to stay  strong zero death here yeah yeah I mean  hey I was saying I wanted to see  Berserker and Vulcan also not have the  same kind of mistakes that they had last  week Berserker is currently 40 and four  on the Varys blabber in all the losses  that C9 had for super Wick a lot of  people were complaining he didn't have  the same level of presence and pressure  that you would normally expect from him  31 and seven here on the Sani only one  kill that he hasn't been a part of here  for this team let's see if this engage  works out in mid lane as who he turned  into a golden statue once again they're  going to put the burst into the Tom  kench and JoJo sits him down C9 have  picked up one and the baron is alive on  the rift now energy are once again  tasked with trying to stop it they now  know how fast C9 is at taking this blade  of the ruin King Varys plus the azir  this this is so difficult for energy to  stop but they're making the approach C9  already have it down to below half HP  down to about 1/3 now Doan contracts  they just know they can't approach all  this is going to be is a team fight loss  on top of a bear and if they go in for  it C9 still chasing seeing if maybe they  can pick one up at the back end of  things set up for the disengage fudge  goes over the wall Q3 won't hit anybody  magical journey don't matter pathmaker  gets him out all right no kills on the  back but C9 is happy to turn a pick into  a bear and never mind we done yet  contract's going to be caught here with  the top C trying to reinforce him keep  protected but fud does a lot of damage  contract still alive as JoJo gets a way  into the back palifox wants to Chase and  JoJo's On The Run palifox goes in but  JoJo shovel him right back palifox  denied energy died and C9 is loving the  way this mid game's been going do is  treding to get away but no sir fudge  knocks him down and berserker's ending  the game the whole time berserker's just  over here violating Towers that's the  ADC dream right there he's inside the  base s the rest of Cloud9 and they're  going for it Cloud n had a rough week  last time around but they're ready to  stop that here who he is not going to  stop anything on his own the C9 lost  streak will grind to a halt as they  defeat energy again 16  to8 JoJo that game really just cracked  open yeah yeah they were able to scale  they were able to play it safe here I  was really yeah the coordination from  energy was just off I feel like this  game mhm energy Kobe you said it best  back at the start energy was just giving  him stuff Cloud9 playing well but  playing reactively not having that  pressure on him to have to make things  happen cuz Energy's just like all right  we're yoloing it go go go botling PVP  PVP and it didn't work out for them  energy is going to have to really work  on the the coordination if they want to  play that crazy play that out of pocket  but for C9 you got to be breathing a  little bit of a sigh relief you get rid  of all of that losing streak that bad  mental and you're finally back feeling  like okay we can execute a little bit  Yeah they went with a with a safe style  here to get that safe first win and  they're going to go crazy tomorrow I  mean hey man it worked out you guys were  talking about having the front line  having the two damage the two threat  damage comp and it worked out the Tia  the vibe both getting shut down by the  time you have that Zia's hourglass video  go on the azir good stuff coming out  from C9 and a reminder to all y'all  fantasy LCS

and JoJo on stage for an  interview Hello I'm here with the  Victorious JoJo Pion after C9 kind of  stopped their losing streaks so first of  all congratulations thank you I mean it  feels kind of weird winning I'm not used  to this right now but there's a good  feeling uh I know in an interview uh  just this past week you actually talked  to Ashley Kong about how losing makes  things more interesting uh do you have  any comments on that after your first  win in a little while I mean I think a  lot of people including me were  expecting like C9 to kind of just [ __ ]  on everyone this whole split um but I  think now that I think about it if we  realize our mistakes right now and we  improve I think that's much better so I  don't think the losses were too bad on  how we reflected on it so yeah and going  into this week uh what was your  preparation like like in draft or I mean  we tried playing a bunch of new  Champions cuz I  think our tramps were kind of obvious of  what we're going to week so I think  we're trying to expand our chample a lot  more so yeah uh when you look at draft  just because it's something that a lot  of the community has pointed out I have  also pointed out and been critical at  times um when you're looking at drafting  for this team I think one thing that  people are curious about in is balancing  the strength of you all as individual  players which is quite high with the  actual coordination of composition so  how much thought goes into that I mean  definitely a lot of thought goes into  that cuz every single player on this  team can carry right so I mean I feel  like that's really good we can make  draft really versatile so that's what  we're trying to do right now um since  every player can carry so yeah nice I  will still defend the VIN mid actually I  mean I thought V mid was good if I had  more practice I definitely could have  carried but it happened nice we'll look  forward to it again in the future maybe  um going forward uh looking out at kind  of how the C9 team is doing obviously  you get the win today uh how are you  guys going to build on this win towards  the  future I mean it's definitely a good  confidence boost that we won today I  think if we lost today it definitely  went out big good so um I think we're  getting our confidence back so yeah all  right well all the best thank you so  much for taking the time to talk to me  and we'll see you guys back on the other  side of the break thank  [Applause]  you  get his back nice we're back this feels  weird what the  I'm used to this hey guys it's hero from  moral Progressive today me and my  teammates are going to be answering  questions from this bowl what type of  books do you like to read I don't even  know cuz I don't read books what are you  most excited about for the future uh me  I will be rich  guy wa that's okay your heart your brain  or your God my brain I'm so smart what's  on the top of your bucket list you know  winning LCS top of my bucket list I was  one game away with tactical 2021 we lost  2 three very disappointing we were all  sub to one dude why'd you put your new  rig in the basement didn't you hear  Bill's a good gillionaire now basically  my new connection is so strong I can  game anywhere check it out we've got  gamer rocker gamer floaty gamer couch  wow it's got wheels gamer bench gamer  throne and gamer  mower what's that it's hard to gamble  walking downstairs I get it that's smart  live like a gillionaire with low latency  everywhere AT&T fiber with Ali  [Applause]  Red Bull gives you  [Music]  wings  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  to those attending today from the  legends of Runa Invitational I think I  think I saw their sign earlier I don't  approve but  welcome Legends rou are greater than  League of Legends a different sign  someone said L greater than either way  we're into Immortals versus Dinger TOS I  think Immortals uh surprising three and  four uh I keep asking if they're good I  rewatched some of the games I think they  are definitely good actually so curious  to see if they can keep up the momentum  against the today yeah I'm curious to  see if Ole keeps picking the highest win  rate supports true Elise was on there he  did not pick it that's not going happen  kind of sad about that you know the hen  special um as we see uh kalista ory  getting banned out by dig and then the  vi and Senna getting B out by maai is  still terrorizing people in soloq I'll  put that out there right now as you can  see in the win rates out there himer is  very doable that seems like a sample  size problem for 60% on we're going to  see the himer oh my goodness I think Mal  maai B I think oh it says Masters plus  yes that's that's always going to be an  minimum 100 games it's like oh yeah he's  6 one and 40 yeah turto what would you  do if your support just turns to you and  they're like I'm picking based on win  rate and that something really weird i'  be extremely open to all of them  actually I do believe the stats so  highest win rate supports sign me up I  actually love that one of the signs pick  allawi you cowards as we're in a rich  game so this guy picked allawi before  the bus came through nice now I mean I I  would be extremely excited to see all uh  on the side of dignitas I I know we've  been talking about them a fair bit being  like an exciting two and five or like  it's nice when the last place team is  this exciting and we have some go graphs  from their previous games and I think it  does speak to how many games they've  actually had leads in you can see three  of those eventual losses one to 100  thieves one to team liqu and one to fly  Quest they had gold leads in the game  after the 20 minute Mark so they're  actually a fairly solid early game team  but they've just been unable to actually  kill the Nexus yeah one thing I really  appreciate as we see the smoulder hover  is it going to go through for dig we  actually did highlight dig as one of  those teams that might be willing to  throw out some picks to try to move  themselves up in the standings we have  our first smolder lock in and we  actually will not know where it's going  until later because like I said uh NAC  was on this patch yesterday and we saw  this champion in both the mid and the  bot Lane yeah and I will say Tomo is the  biggest smolder appreciator in world so  even when he was not available in the  last week's games he was still playing  the pick so I feel like he's the most  studed up on the champion so even if it  is a a decent Flex pick I fully expect  it to go over to Tomo I kind of think if  Castle's not careful with his pick it's  going to go tall oh Rich Quinn smolder  what's the  difference both any carries right Rich's  eyes are wide  open let's go all right so for IMT we  have the Zer lock in we also I do want  to call out the um Ivor turn for Aro  that's one of his uh Stronger Champions  we've seen him have success on that  against C9 and also tactical with uh Zer  even though he's on a three and four  team leads the LCS in kills you can see  Tomo fourth place in kills as well so  this is one of the reasons I think the  bottom of the standing seems so exciting  is these teams that haven't necessarily  won all the games are actually leading  the league in kills which is super not  normal yeah and I think it made sense to  everybody going in from the off season  cuz at least for IMT say like they had a  clear identity that they wanted to play  through mid and wanted to play through  bot Lane and it makes sense Olay is a  trigger happy support if he gets a hand  on Thresh Nautilus or anything like that  he's going to be calling for help in the  bot side of the map but we know how Lane  focused tactical is as a player so it  makes a lot of sense and I feel like  their winds have come off the back of it  this is a really exciting G so far  actually I just love the fact that we're  seeing the buffed up Zer it has hyper  carryer potential because of our Mayo's  Iver and we have this smolder mystery  not only is it going to be the first  smolder in the LCS we still don't know  where it's going to go you can't okay  smolder in atro would be trash I  think what into atrox would be garbage  yeah I I don't garage it's it's to I'm  pretty sure it's going to be bottom it's  too what is the uh so talk to us a  little bit about the zeri smolder  matchup so the zeri smolder matchup is  uh I think it's favor to Zer like past  like level level six I think like pre  six like small D just has is full  advantage smolder can just keep pushing  the wave and poking Zer down but I think  at level six um Zer can just look for  all all in timers and a question that I  have is like what support do you usually  want to pair up with a smolder in  general um that's actually a tricky  question I've seen teams play um  enchanters and heart supports or heart  engag supports yeah  um I I feel like the millio might  actually be a good pairing with smolder  just to increase the range that makes  sense to me I think he's going to have  have a tough time dealing with Iver just  in general having to dip in and out of  his bushes so that's a question that I  would have but you could just get like a  hard engage support too I guess like the  Recon and just set up the Alti you know  yeah if they lock this in well would  Flex to Jungle and we know their Lane  that also gives Ole the counter pick  potential but yeah oh play man he can't  cuz uh dig banned out uh dig got rid of  both the  and I assume the well not I assume we  know the maai fan is going up against uh  Ole and not Aro who's already locked in  Iver way support or midy way support is  not the win rate King let me tell you so  we'll see I saw Barrel do really well in  one series I don't know what Ole would  pick here knowing Ole though he might  just pick like barter or  something locked in I mean it could be  ol on way support but we'll obviously  know with this last pick yeah I think  any form of engage here would be nice  Leona was something that was coming up  to mind just because you're going up  against the raon so pretty clearcut way  of engaging into dignas comp I just feel  like Lon is not a very good Champion  right  now why is that we'll see though I I  just feel like she dies very easily when  she goes in she's just committed it's  kind of easy to just beat  up a lot of engage on the side of dig  let's see what they end up locking here  this is yeah this is super interesting I  mean I'm going to hold to say this is  still a flex but it's it's actually  could be yon Top Lane into the atrox if  they want to end up going so this is a  really Dynamic comp from dignitas  actually this is really exciting Real's  going to probably be their I guess they  have con yeah jungler sole form of  engage so I'm really loving the comp  that we have here and jat I want you to  ask the question one more time uh what's  the question Raz is is IMT good are they  cuzz even though we're talking about the  draft and that has been the focus for me  it's been the play it's something  different about IMT that we've been  seeing in their recent games and  especially in their wins and for me  mistakes like these that we see from  mask where he ends up making a misplay  when they go up against Cloud9 usually  costs them the game because you know you  make one mistake Barons are going to be  an issue and in this play actually IMT  not only recognized they're going to be  a man down they're sticking around just  they can dissuade from a C9 going for  Baron here but they realize one thing  and one thing clearly C9 is dissipating  UD a is going towards the midlane wave  so they're actually separated so bar  just sends the Alti they find a 4v5 play  being able to pick off JoJo Pion and  they end up winning a fight and imts in  the past usually play extremely scared  don't look for plays like that but this  is a different IMT to me where they make  a mistake initially stick around a  little bit for Baron and they capitalize  on a misplay coming in from C9 and I  think they they can do the same versus  diing toss Raz is a big castle fan  Castle on atrax once again let's head to  the casters get us into the  game ladies and gentlemen welcome back  to the LCS it's Immortals versus  dignitas and it's time for two  simultaneous debuts not only the first  smolder played in the LCS as he just now  became  playable yep it's the first whe in the  LCS as well they're on opposite sides of  the rift one starts out with 100% win  rate the other one's got big fat donut  yeah and smolder of course it actually  was picked in Challengers but this is  the first pick for smolder in any tier  one region um so I'm very excited for  this champ I want to see if we're going  to get the Spear of sojan start for him  because that has really been gaining  popularity you get so much ability haste  that that item is the Premier Source of  ability haste now that they started  removing it from a lot of other sources  um and you are able to stack so insanely  quickly with it I'm really interested to  see it specifically in this game cuz  it's up against Zer I was talking to  shogo who's a multi- region Challenger  player won sew a couple of times asking  him about it cuz he was posting a lot of  screenshots about you know winning with  it in Challenger here's how you play it  and he was talking about how it feels  like it has a similar role to aeria  aiver where it might not command  powerful early Lane pryo but if you get  out of Lane without being behind you're  going to outpace your opponent you're  going to have so much AOE damage so much  scaling potential and considering he's  up against the pentakill Pikachu that  inspired nightmares in players for  multiple multiple months I really want  to see how this head-to-head shakes out  P to kill Pikachu with a fresh shiny  buff flowers yes sir Bas ad up on Zer  ultimate as well here tactical was one  of our original Zer players too if you  remember he had a viral clip but rich is  surrounded yeah he immediately flashes  away the root collar if that would have  hit him there he could have been in some  serious trouble D this is is such a sick  draft from both squads this game is so  fun there's so many things to talk about  because Ivor is one of my favorite  pairings for any jungle Plus ad carry  obviously the one on camera now Quay  first LCS pick has been pretty popular  in the LC honestly but um smolder here  hiding from us flowers who's that  Pokemon what who was behind that brush  who could it be who could possibly be in  there so I do have to I'm just going to  go ahead I'm going to come clean about  something right now before the minions  spawn honesty is the best policy flowers  I have no idea what this dude's  abilities are not even the beginning of  a compreh way right cuz I know you know  I know smolder ability name say them now  say them and you're going to like it  super Scorch your breath auu flap flap  flap and Mom there you go there we've  got all of them my favorite part is the  my my favorite part is the little wiggle  when he screams mom fall out the dragon  it's so funny to watch that ultimate by  the way since it starts behind you  sometimes for Lane phase uh you know  people will cast it backwards so you can  get the quicker uh end of it yeah down  on them but we we'll see there's so many  tips and tricks to go over uh right now  in Lane though mask being our first LCS  Quay this is a champion that um I I have  a lot of confidence in the team fighting  of sometimes you can it can get a little  dicey towards the early stage you know  when people are ganking you and never  mind hold  on a little spicy down here really low  yeah can get can get a little dicey  early on in some skirmishes and ganking  but the champ scal so well cuz you have  just massive AOE and really strong range  So speaking of scaling up I do want to  go ahead and just talk really quickly  about a couple of smolder points cuz I  know a lot of people either haven't  played them maybe they don't play any  carries I didn't bother reading the tool  tips the break points you got to look at  for his stacks and you get a stack for  last hitting with q or damaging an enemy  with any spell  25 gets you your first AOE your farming  is really slow until you hit 25 then 125  gets you the ones that bounce behind and  225 is your imop now level 16 kale type  of moment where you're spewing true  damage onto everybody with a DOT it's  very very strong but that's what we're  going to keep track of is how fast he  can hit that 225 great Point yeah and  you can all keep track at home look at  this nice little Nifty passive tracker  that they have over smolder uh in the  bottom right there currently at 13 now  generally the the aim is to get it by  around you know mid game 20 minutes kind  of average there have been some crazy  ones I was talking with you know the  guys on the dive about it ail was like  he got to 225 at like 17 minutes that's  really fast there are there are some  early ones um of course you know if you  get some really nice bounces you can you  can throw your snot ball through two CHS  at once you got to call it hold on rich  is trying to get away from a gank here  in the Top Lane Aro shows up Castle  should have enough damage to bring him  down here it's First Blood over to the  Iver the burn from Red takes him out  imortal every snotball though on the is  that  wrong it's a tree he don't have snot the  snot is in the oh the dragon is Oh I  thought you were saying Aro hit him with  a snot ball no no no like haven't you  played ivern oh the dragon is the one  with the snot ball that tries to stack  up with it you got to stack your notnot  balls if you want to succeed on small  it's called a che and the big fiery ball  comes out anyway Aro is on the invade  here and did uh did catch him on those  on those Raptors so they got visual  confirmation that he's on the top side  nice quick trading there coming out from  mask as Rich again has to respect has to  be careful he's got the ward there in  the pixel brush that lets him know that  our Mayo is hanging around yes ex there  it is also nearby got a got a stack we  got another stack he only needs two more  and then he has the AOE on the Q which  like I said is going to make it much  easier to really accelerate the pacing  of those Stacks you get all the range  minions low hit one of them with a Q it  blows up all three nothing to it very  fast farming as he has cleared the  threshold Now 26 Stacks 5 minutes into  the game he gets the first evolution all  right smoulder scaling nicely on bottom  side meanwhile pushing mid lane with qu  pretty effortless there Max making good  use of the Mana return Auto attacks  shoving in Dove taking out so much of  his HP uh of the turret plate himself  and does get his first back Castle  dodging away from the Q3 there from Rich  means that they will not have the CC to  lock him down long enough for XU to make  an entrance even with crash down Castle  can just get away from it so XU has to  walk it off now we can actually talk  about some of the regular Champions here  since there are so many things to  discuss as XU will be able to clean up  all of the kugs cuz re is one of the  best or grub taker on the rift but  Mortals if we're examining their draft  then one of the things that goes under  the radar with all of these new picks is  Castle's atro and if we bring up their  previous games here never mind we might  have too much action Tomo just face  checking into the brush there oay  immediately hitting him with the shield  of Daybreak forcing out the cleanse the  flash to follow it Olay is getting the  money and Tomo's down nice Olay Killer  Instinct here in the brush Leona  flashing on him has the ignite death to  the Dragon number one but there's the  castle atro stats very good for  immortals last week was very good to  them and he had couple of those ones  dropped so feels very confident on the  champion I know and Immortals here also  have some really good late game options  not just the lanes but the ivn plus the  zeri for later on Quay really big AOE  damage for a lot of these clumped up  melee Champions that dignitas have  drafted that ultimate that's on display  for you now is going to be one of those  big tools that mask has to counter uh  these grouped up melee champs as  dignitas all but the  dragon um should provide pretty good  damage soaks here for Mass to be able to  dump his spells into and as mass  continues putting points in the  abilities as he levels up and really  maxing out that subject disaster the  Quee for all the damage can clear out  those waves incredibly quickly with that  pseudo Rumble ulti that he can cast  through the molten as is and Tomo just  absorbing some pressure here as our Mayo  makes his appearance known in the bottom  side MK could get ganked by XU as he'll  approach from the control warded brush  and remember last time around when these  two teams did play dignos got the win  mass does get hit Mass getting hit as  the immediate follow up with a flash  from XU they need a little bit more  damage and they'll find it dignitas gets  their first kill of the game and they  get it on Dove yeah that's the worst of  the outcomes possible for Mass to flash  afterwards he does not Flash the chain  and once Dove hits the chain beautiful  followup from xq flashes in with the  rail full combo and then with mask also  flashing after that and still dying very  very big possible momentum here starter  for dignitas asylus getting early kills  is always so so nice o not afraid to  just immediately jump in and fight  against the Recon Leona being one of  those picks that whenever the meta is z  raan defined in the bottom Lane Leona  will eventually show up if enough time  passes without Nerfs because of how  excellent she can play into raon as a  champion but Mas I mean he's got range  he's got power he's got CC but he has no  Mobility whats got Grace he can throw a  puddle on the ground and walk a little  faster through it but now top side it's  Castle under pressure and he's not going  to get very far exu takes him down  dignitas ties the game exu the Highlight  here for dignitas the first one was set  up for him really easily in mid lane by  dub hitting a nice chain uh uh but there  goes back topside gets another gank off  takes down Castle is going to be a  dragon in compensation here for  immortals since the enemy jungler shows  top side but that is some nice money  into rich on a rich style Top Lane  takeover Champion yon truly the  possibilities of the 1 v9 trying to get  that combo the dream scenario into the  backline where he could annihilate the  Zer and the H those really strong late  game carries so we see what Rich can do  because in the last year with digas most  of the stories that we were telling were  about rich Champions and yeah stuff he  was picking in the top side and his  counter picks for Top Lane and the  possibilities of running over the game  there so XU doing a good job setting up  both his solo Lanes so far mask could be  in trouble XU staying right on the very  edge of  vision mask still stepping back up XU is  just going to try to steal away this  chicken Camp he can see that it's primed  with the The Grove from the Iver uhhuh  that always feels so good oh yeah I just  be like oh you wanted to come pick these  up huh uh no you put some work into this  you spend some health and some Mana to  channel on this damn shame yoink all  cast q and their mind well dignitas  still trying to get enough Stacks here  on Tomo that's exactly what I was  talking about right there you get either  all three melees or all three rang low  and then execute them with one super  Scorch your breath together he's up to  65 Stacks remember again the next break  point 125 is going to get the smaller  bouncing projectiles after the first one  that can help you clear entire waves at  once and because ivn is support style  jungler gets to build support items  pretty cheap and got the early Moonstone  there with the classic dark seal uh-oh  Mass getting jumped on here the upscan  the ABD do the immediate crash down to  follow it up but Immortals are keeping  their mid laner alive a massive amount  of AOE the spiraling despair has found  multiple targets dub dies first mass  stays alive Rich misses the Target and  he barely finds the kill in the back end  but now Castle's made his rotation into  the fight here too Aro with a roof  caller and rich is about to drop  Immortals outplay him and slay him baby  they underestimated way and they do not  live to tell the tale the Ivan with the  Moonstone completed empowered Shields  keeping them alive and Aro flashes for  the root collar to make sure they get  two of them let's take another look at  just how much he's able to Shield here  so as he's getting charged in on big  double one comes in then he gets out the  daisy as well and even though they get  charms up look at this massive AOE Mass  kiing back he's able to put out so much  another Shield comes up from Aro they're  able to save him long enough that they  get the two kills and by the time Rich  comes in here with the flash  ultimates he's got no team left and  aro's able to flash follow him rollar to  allow the rest of the team to pick it up  and the grubs will go their way and ha's  passive is designed for fights like that  being able to trigger the ability  explosions on multiple clumped up enemy  Champions that situation ended up great  for immortals they're up 1,000 gold and  a drake so far yeah really really  exactly the type of fight that Immortals  want where Mass gets to tank it up with  multiple ivn Shields giant AOE damage  coming through giving them one of the  neutral objectives as well  afterwards and now they're taking over  jungle here there went the ulti I have  to say the name out loud cuz it wasn't  really used for anything cool get the  ground we're not going to overdo it m  mhm wait for later I'm just waiting for  your big moment I got I got to pick my  moment man I got to pick my moment that  was not the moment Immortals just  continuing to push up here there's that  molten fissure I was talking about like  once you have all the levels in the  queue once you have a little bit of AP  you just kind of blast the wave and go  look for something else to do yeah it's  one of the big difficulties for this  dignitas comp is the jungle has already  been taken over XU gets pushed out but  he got his gromp right now huddle behind  the Tower as that turret plate you know  tactical wants this turret plate so bad  yeah he's so close to it he will get it  before uh the 14-minute mark for sure as  I get to push in afterwards here but  does start to get really hard for dig  because one of the things they're  lacking with this team comp is the wave  clear like we highlighted earlier on  they're fairly short range except for  tomo except for the dragon everybody is  melee there and so you're going to be  you got to come from different angles  and try not to give this way to any nice  setups here um you have a a big problem  if a o AOE comes down from Olay he sets  it up iron slows come down from the  shields popping off of him as well and  and your uh your melees get massively  AOE down but the dragon is a scaling  tommo at 90 now at 13 and a half minutes  into the game so he's on Pace well he's  going to have to make sure he does not  lose that pace as Reaver completed at  his first item too I know you were  thinking about builds so going to go  with that one that guarantees not only  do you get the sheen proc on your Q's  but now they're refunding more Mana than  they cost yeah and if you do go for the  essence Reaver uh start then you're  going to need to go for the navori quick  blades to follow that one up ARO ARO  getting caught here in a 3v2 the burst  from Dove is enough and the shutdown  goes to the dignitas mid laner nice pick  up that brush right there the banana  Brush by the Herold SLG grub SL Baron  pit the void pit there's a lot of people  living in this one apartment now it's  it's a really crowded bit now um  Honestly though getting control Wards  into that brush early on into the game  almost always pays dividends Rich okay  the One V one Castle trying to flash it  out playo but he doesn't Rich does not  have the power of God and Anime on his  side Castle is too strong even with the  blade of the Run King uh finish there  loses the Allin Castle atrox you said it  brings it home again and since they did  get three of the grubs he has a little  bit of extra pushing power with the  damage over time will get a huge reward  Here solo outer Tower in addition to the  solo kill feels good man one one and two  here on this guy up 500 gold over his  opponent took out the turret should be  able to go back to base and acquire that  completed profane Hydra massive power  Spike faor My Favorite that thing is so  juicy big burst damage but here's a look  at it and I think the big part is going  to be the Q3 so there's q1 Castle nice  flash over God he hits all of them yeah  good P he got the passive Auto before  the ult too and then q3's backwards  right on top of him cuz he knows where  yon is going to land that ultimate  coming through and the Q3 is coming down  on your head very well read There by  Castle knowing how to play against those  High Mobility Champions and you can see  the frustration on Rich's face he's like  damn he got me complet completely  outplayed top side overloaded here with  dig nice rotation from them they bring  over the jungle support from mid lane to  allow Dove to get his outer Tower as  well get some more money into this stus  who by the way R of Ages got some nice  Buffs on the patch as well yes sir  little bit of extra HP and mana on that  one for him okay still a very close game  here both games so far today have not  had these runaway early games for either  side as we'll see Immortals pick up  another Drake for themselves dignitas  are not doing super great in the neutral  objective contest here so far but  remember they did get the herald off the  back of their previous pick on Aro we're  still yet to see what they can  accomplish with that this is so fun  we're going to get to test Zer scaling  with an ivern on our team by the way to  buffer up versus the Omega Dragon  scaling and  1640 into the game 128 now here so again  we're still looking every scaling point  is nice but you know you know the big  one you know 225 is what everybody's  looking at here yeah um and especially  once you get your quick blades too don't  underestimate reducing the cool down on  your flap flap flap the kiing ability of  of the smolder sounds is huge for later  because uh the Synergy is there when  you're able to reduce the cool down and  keep it going as we get the charges keep  on going here yeah there it goes big old  charge down the bottom Lane with a bunch  of void mes popping out Castle's ready  to defend though they'll lose about half  HP on that tier two mask is going to  take the tier one of dignitas on the  opposite side of the map at the same  time just letting that turret finish off  as many of the minions as possible while  he hits the wave so there you go game  still just so close between these two  squads we're 2 and A2 minutes away from  Baron spawning on the  rift and we've got smolder still  stacking up he it was 5 minutes for  Evolution 1 1645 you said it for  Evolution 2 and most players want to try  to get this in the low 20s for the 225  you really need that true damage burn to  feel like you're living your best life  as a little baby definitely agree there  um honestly this game I just feel like  ivn is going to do so much work flowers  so much potential here with Redemption  finish second this is this is one of the  uh preferred builds with giant melee  clumps if you get a Redemption huge  value from healing up not only your team  in your front line here trying to hold  the line where you're throwing Shields  into Castle you're throwing the  Redemption down to keep them going uh  make sure that squishier lethality atrox  stays upright but you're going to get  huge value over all these dignitas  members too it just feels like the team  fight of Immortals has so much potential  uh to be able to to to destroy them that  dignitas got to continue to look for  some of these aggressive angles and the  vision these Wards are going to be a  problem for them they've been scouted  they've been seen and Immortals here  moving in yeah but they didn't have the  damage dealers close enough immediately  it was our mayo and oay far up while  mask and tactical were trying to catch  up so dignitas had enough time to  disengage and yeah worth pointing out  even if we take the smallest values  possible from the Redemption it's 200  Health restored to Allied Champions 10%  Max HP true damage to enemies if you got  all 10 dudes in the circle that's a  2,000 HP swing between the damage being  done and the health being healed with  minimum values intense stuff we'll see  how much value our Mayo can get out of  that as the game moves on under 2  minutes until the next Drake is taken  it's another Mountain Rift and it's a  two lead for immortals there do you  think dig tries to stop him from getting  soulle point or do you just say nope we  got to wait on smolder 225 fight him for  soul honestly I really want that smolder  225 okay I feel like that is the win con  here for dignitas it does so much when  you get that extra burn you have the  execute as well uh and dingas like they  they will have a massive engage you know  it's it's going to be explosive they're  either going to win in a big way or  they're going to lose in a big way and I  have had a lot of faith here in exus and  gages already on the ra so maybe they do  find the angle maybe they do get that  dream yon followup you know real plus  yon combinations and raon yeah is has  definitely been been performing so far  this year in the LCS and him with flash  is always deadly o wants to keep trying  to fight these guys contest for the  vision in the top side River Baron is  live on the rift now 20 minutes 30  seconds into the game another 45 or so  to go until that Drake spawns as we can  see couple of resets coming out as  everybody wants to go back get their  Vision complete their items if you know  a team fight's coming up you got to be  ready ahead of time Recall now for tomo  I assume he's probably got the money for  the naori quick blades he goes back and  yep there it is okay two it power Spike  for him two item power Spike for the  silus we already talked about two items  for ivern but he buys he buys cheap  stuff like count the same way two items  for the atrox here as well hey two two  item discounts still two items uh when  they're when they're this impactful it  was kind of nice in the in the offseason  they gave some little Buffs to a lot of  the support items so Iver got to benefit  from that as well as oay here with the  shields trying to fight that Vision  fight or may just spamming them [ __ ]  not afraid to jump over the wall oay  throws out the eclipse there ready to  make sure that he can tank up if the  fight breaks out but dignitas does not  want to full commit to anything here  just yet tactical will try to find  whatever poke he can with the zap as  mask wants to push out the mid lane but  Tomo's happy to answer 200 stack flowers  They're going to fight on the dragon 200  Stacks if Immortals can force a fight  before he hits 225 it could really  change the landscape of things here as  exu is Behind Enemy Lines a TP coming in  from dig to reinforce but the whole crew  is there from immortal Ching after XU  root caller thrown out at the very last  second but XU can get away in time  dignitas grouping back up together here  in the botside river now I got to say it  didn't look like much but that is really  big Immortals Castle specifically going  to try and Mark him and getting that ra  flash blown finding him on the side good  awareness from Immortals they know  they're just looking out for these  flanks for the Allin for dig that  explosive engage and Castle goes to Mark  the the critical component of that now  with no flash on XU is going to be much  more difficult for them to actually make  the huge play 211 stacks on the smolder  dignitas is trying to buy enough time to  get there but Immortals are tired of  letting him do it oay takes some poke  from the dragon snot bubble here comes  the M Immortals trying to stay tall of  the river now with O's in the middle of  two massive AOE WBO combo coming over  the top and D tries to dive in and mass  grab the kill back of the is XU is shut  down the dragon damage is pouring in 232  Stacks with to go as Castle tries to  fight Dove not enough HP to keep this  one going it's two dead on both sides a  3v3 in the bot side River but health  bars favor dignitas okay we got rich  still here with his blade of the Run  King he can melt through these Mountain  dragons Tomo here poking around they  want to wait for it though no jungle  Smite for them and they're too scared of  an armo steal they back off after the  leash flowers he got the stat now after  fight he is working through it now we're  going to see smolder really shine here's  another look at the engag though so they  got the nice slow with the stop bubble  like you called out mom came to follow  it up and then on the top side du duve  is working his way through Castle while  Olay went in for the counter engage and  rich just over the top finishes it off  so they get this big explosion tactical  and our Mayo got chunked out and had to  run away super early on but we aren't  done we're ready to go Tomo and the rest  to dignitas starting up the dragon Tomo  just going to keep spitting those  Fireballs trying to poke however he can  the Drake down to about 5,000 HP the mom  comes in over the top as it only hits  oay not a lot of value coming out from  that one Dragon still at 4K dignitas  trying to keep the health bars high but  Immortals are doing the same thing Rich  versus Castle here in the botside river  as Castle takes the burst but Rich  disengages back over the wall o ready to  follow up here with the engage XU locked  down but Immortals have to back away  Isles explod way Paints the Masterpiece  and it's written in the blood of  dignitas Rich tries to stay alive as  Dove wants to escape back of the wall he  won't be sniped down but it ain't going  to matter Tomo and Dove still alive  there's a oneman Advantage for immortals  Dove still trying to get away as mask  wants to chase him not quite enough  range to get that done here yet wanted  to see about a snipe again Dove getting  that wave shoved up the Drake now  finally going to be finished off by  Immortals I feel like this was a 4minute  drake sequence it was it was that was  part two this this was a sequel here  from The dignitas Immortals Banger  flowers I love live patch we have so  much to go over in this look at that  Engage The Root caller actually delayed  Dub's followup so it could have been  even bigger for dig but Quay damage  explodes on digitas as they're grouped  up after it even with the giant engage  and then Castle gets to run through them  chasing them  off so much fun here trying to keep up  with uh all of the extra explosions and  in the middle of it all too well there  you go  5.4k The Quay explosions that's what we  kept warning about the massive AOE  potential of this Immortals lineup that  they've drafted here in these mid and  late game team fights he's he's so scary  if everybody just wants to have a  meatball wrestling match it's not going  to work out so great if here against him  hes getting locked down by Ole here on  the front again a little bit of damage  that Way's looking for not going to  connect in time on the back end of  things remember that spell will do bonus  damage if you are immobilized or  isolated MH and the bonus damage is a  bunch it's like a rocket yeah you don't  want to get hit by that thing a lot of  people too pretty popular in Solo que is  going for the Horizon focus never mind  though as XU is flanked around they're  going to teleport and go for the  collapse dig TOS trying to find their  fight here is coming in for the followup  mortal trying to get everybody away but  tactical is thrown up into the air he's  caught he's down Mo comes in over the  wall but she ain't even needed just yet  Castle trying to fight in the middle of  four he needs the Q3 to come down for  the healing but he's going to be shut  down by Tomo before it happens dignitas  just killed two and one of them's the ad  carry now they have health bars a little  bit dicey here for is and Dove but  they're heading back over to Baron what  a call from dig there the game on the  edge and they're going to be able to  make the critical pick tactical and  Castle both down Isles here very low  doesn't have hope but they're going to  teleport Rich right back in they want to  bring Dove back into this fight he had  to go back and heal but the unleash TP  is ready to go Immortals do not want to  lose the remaining three players Dove  steals away a cloned Daisy and baron  goes to dignitas dignitas they may be  down dragons but they're up in Gold  they're up Baron now and they should be  able to get more afterwards St here  trying to push with  Daisy Mass going to have to be careful  you got to respect the daisy knockups  finally going to kill that one off tier  one turrets still being just chipped  down by this cannon minion blessed by  Dove one more oh no he got distracted  yeah the stolen away AP Daisy gives her  uh some extra oomph there and Dove will  be able to keep it keep up the pressure  here take down outer turret number one  see if they can get bottom Lane moving  as well for dignitas cuz the rest of the  team has gotten their full reset and  their purchases Tomos went for the rapid  fire Cannon this by the way since your Q  range on smolder is the same for your  your auto attack then it increases your  Q range for the rapid fire and you can  get some nice long range Fireball poke  going for tomo especially now that he's  got the upgrades the extra true damage  this dragon is scary man  37 Stacks let me look at what that says  then so every Q which is on a 2.2 second  cool down if you don't hit something  with theori cool down reduction 6.5% Max  HP true damage over 3 seconds if you  drop below N9 boom you're dead that you  add those together it's 15% if he hits  you and you are at 15% HP it'll take you  a couple seconds but you're dead that's  almost Elder move over Zary we've got a  new late game yeah this guy is going to  be trouble for immortals the further  this game goes but right now it's  Immortals that are having to respond to  dig dig Nas are driving the car and  they're headed straight for the IMT  structures all right couple more hits  yeah bottom Lane too is work worked up  here rich on the level 16 Yon bottom  putting pressure on castle with these  bared up minions whittling away at  bottom Tower while the mid lane Tower  was slowly being whittled down but they  know they have to get ready they have to  get reset and ready for this Dragon  because while they are now up almost  5,000 gold for dig they're still facing  multiple dragon souls that they're going  to have to deal with in this game even  if they defend this first one they  constantly have to be worried about this  objective coming up so did get their  reset off in order to prepare for dragon  all right let's see it man 20 seconds  dignitas want to keep this control going  the baron is going to last just long  enough for the Drake to First spawn Tomo  is happy to just be left on his own to  farm up all these waves get all those  free Stacks that's a thing too late game  smolder with a Mobility with your cool  down reduction from your quick blades on  uh your flat flap flap just feels like  he's able to kite so well yeah and with  all the melee protection here they do  have a lot of PE  Olay going to take a lot of burst here  from the front line he not tanky enough  Leona's already dead BR went in to  create space to guarantee the kill then  he can use the soul Unbound to reset his  position and get right back out now  Castle immediately losing half HP there  to the smolder has to retreat and  dignitas I would have to think they've  all but secured their Drake here as Mas  gets to flash out the mom damage over  the top again not going to find any huge  payoff but Immortals have already been  forced back yeah that's going to be  Dragon Defense number one compl complet  for  dignitas secured here Dragon poke in  Middle oay Down Easy Drake pick up and  they retain pressure in both mid and  bottom Immortals trying to farm up there  Zary tactical here doing his best with  the new static shiv uh this game you  know still possibilities of trying to  have a Zer moment later on into the game  once you get a couple more uh you know  items coming through here he's already  on three has has his own quick blades  Aro went with the staff of flowing water  for the extra AP and move speed buff  here which is very good to put on mask  as well for the positioning for the H  for the amplification there too so we'll  see Immortals their hopes still alive in  this game they do have the advantage in  wave clear of course they are the ones  with a way they've got some nice uh bits  of range here they've got the  electricity on their side as well so  they're trying to stall it out they're  trying continue to farm it up here but  it's just ominous when you're across the  the rift from a smolder and now it's a  four item completed smolder with the  armor penetration from Lord Doms coming  in it's Tomo's time to shine baby yeah  he's set to carry man and I agree I  think that Immortals yeah you can still  win but everything's got to be set up  perfectly qu needs massive AOE Zer needs  to have that Zer moment as the mid lane  tier 2 turret Falls dignitas keep their  push going also I want to keep a magnif  find glass on Dove take a moment to talk  about him from dignitas because he has  not really been in the spotlight there  were a couple games where like he got  that air Quadra and they were trying to  come back but then they didn't get the  comeback so didn't get a lot of the  credit there but his stus is actually  almost about to complete a death cap  he's got two of the needlessly large  rods he's up to 17 now he's got the  extra amplification here the uh the  lichbane as well has been doing work and  a lot of this burst coming through so  we'll see currently they're splitting up  into the one through one for dignitas  both Dove and Rich with their teleports  ready and looks like Dove himself up to  the tower with that Lit Bane nice little  chunk here yeah I mean when you look at  the when you look at the 11 kills of  dignitas raan's been there for nine of  them Silas for 10 of them re for all 11  the setup here has been pretty fantastic  for these guys in the fights all working  together for these efforts but they  still have to crack the enemy base  there's 13 seconds until Baron spawns  again Tomo trying to make sure he does  not get caught XU speeding him up just  making sure they can both walk away from  this one all right we're cool we're  chilling okay look at all these wards  that you could teleport flank on too  though as Immortals push out yeah they  need to collapse back into their own  territory here nice move from Immortals  they know it's getting a little  dangerous on the other half of the map  it's it's been in dignitas control for  so long it's littered with Wards all  right dignitas with control over the top  side River control over the baron pit TP  coming in they want to make sure that  everybody's ready to join in for this  one dove has the stolen way ulti that  spiraling despair that incredibly  effective clumped up team fighting tool  dignitas are not going to start the  baron just yet they're going to wait for  immortals to approach and hope to punish  Castle wants to walk up here from this  angle but he's got to be careful Tomo  again they're going to put some damage  into Ole Castle could be caught as rich  and X both go in but they ain't going to  find the mark smolder Al goes wide  Immortals regroup they're going to be  healed and shielded by Aro diver but now  which wants to drive in it's O right in  the middle of everybody but Tomo's ready  to counter attack Castle wants the  smolder but he ain't going to find him  Tomo's already killed off too and now  Immortals where can you even go a triple  kill back to smolder dignitas are ready  to March it down mid for the Nexus yeah  I think Immortals going to have to go  back to the gray screen dignitas  knocking on the front door Rich keeping  the dive alive as tactical has to flash  out just to survive it dignitas with a  fiveman push keeping things going for  119 stacks on the smolder level 18 now  they should just Brute Force this down  10 seconds on oay 25 on the two solo  laners of Immortals as tactical will not  live through it Isles and the rest of  dignitas will get this done they will  tie Immortals in the standings and take  them out in 34  minutes  digitas another victory over  Immortals the first first ones to use  smolder and a really exceptional  performance on the silus from Dove yes  sir bringing it all together so much fun  to watch both of these squads iow will  dominate actually had a really nice  tweet about the LCS and the the level  here of the players in this split really  leading to the thought process of anyone  could be anyone right now these teams  are really Scrappy and theyve they've  shown in a lot of these  games some really strong team fighting I  also like that we got to see some high  moments for H even though there wasn't a  victory for immortals there were some  real pop off moments in those team  fights where he got that ideal situation  and really showcased the strengths of  the champion I hope we get to see both  of these Champions some more I agree  with you it's part of the fun of live  patch is you just always get to see the  newest and most exciting things  happening and getting to see these two  go head to-head in their debut for LCS  for both was a lot of fun honored all  yall during the 2024 spring split you  can use your master card to make a  purchase from the in client store save  that card on file to be entered for a  chance to win a trip to A League of  Legends event or eight player of the  week statues right now we're headed to  break before 100 thieves versus TL but  first let's take a look at this year's  first are you smarter than featuring a  brand new  host this Pro taught himself English  through talking to an AI I got bait I  got ba list as many items that build  from this specific item these guys are  nerves I am going to give you eight  players put them in order from youngest  to  oldest this time it's are you smarter  than LCS Pro because analysts we got  them out here they don't know um we have  fly Quest versus jitas here we're going  to start off with new Champions I am  going to start to read an ability to you  you have to say the champion and the  ability each of your teams vote who's  your first  vione of  it's not me bro I don't know any of all  right hands behind your back oh that's  important yes are you ready molten  fissure that is h q e yep two points to  fly Quest you guys are good I would have  not even the really all right maybe  we'll be seeing some support way from  fly who's next okay I go next y you  can't you can't just keep sending boio  up you know I'm sure I know the meta all  right Crimson  curse can you lose points if you guess  wrong you do not lose points if you  guess wrong but if you guess wrong it  goes automatically to the other team and  they can talk can I  press you do not know it you still can't  discuss your team I'm going to now read  the ability and give you the ability  type for one point this Champion gains 0  to 50% based on missing Health increased  healing based on her missing health and  her attacks and abilities apply  uh Briar passive yes nice thank you  thank  you all right I'm getting in there oh GG  it's it might be lost yeah it's going to  be a feel  now all right crushing  Maul yes has to be enough here e  nope so you guys now get to discuss  amongst yourselves for two points so if  they if you you can talk to them I got  baited I got baited I got baited I got I  think it's Bri I think it's Bri I think  it's his e the one where he's like  screaming no that's no that's something  Screech or scream I think it's fine they  don't know like look at them oh it is he  it's think all right all right  answer yes we knew all right same  matchups was your backup I I think I  can't win this match up apparently it's  just one darken  daggers NE yes let's go two points I was  slow I was slow got the easy one let's  go he was fast all right when can I take  my head out of my back like the moment  you say the first letter of the question  yep certain  death Naf no  it's yes let's go I'm sorry guys we're  on the up and up we're on the up it up  last one for for uh Champions ready  eviscerate the fury e yes wow bro I I  played him in Aram two days ago first  time ever playing the shamp wow these  guys are nerds that just wraps up up  round one we'll see you after next game  look what I've just  made the perfect Pearl not too bad but  check this  out waa a true Venus clam Red Bull gives  you  wings the new Red Bull C blue Edition  with the taste of  Juneberry wings for for every  [Music]  taste  [Music]  [Music]  what's up everyone I've got the  Victorious Tomo here for this interview  after a  win how is that game from your  perspective it felt hectic as  hell yeah I think we made a lot of  blenders early game but thankfully our  team comp is pretty strong I have  smolder so I just went my late game as  you saw um so yeah you had like  something like 422 Stacks at the end  like we expected if there was going to  be a smolder player it would be you it  felt like you were playing the pick in  Solo CU a lot even before you guys were  scouting me a little bit okay we were  aware okay so we were watching um just  your thoughts on the champion overall  because now you you got finally got to  pull it out first smolder in LCS first  region to be able to play it yeah I was  playing in scrims a lot and it just felt  really good for our team in general I  think it fits our play style um and yeah  I really enjoy the champion I think it's  really exciting and fun to play so it  just helps with that too just like it's  more engaging to play I've seen a lot of  bad smolders out there in Solo can you  give us any like tips or tricks just  anything that you've seen people mess up  on the most that you learned on your  like week and a half I guess in playing  the champion honestly just just Farm  you're really fragile game obviously  like you're a little dragon you just  want to farm camps you know like later  on I was just eating every single Camp  my jungler just like offered everything  to me so yeah just scale once you get  sacked you're just broken I think that  was the trick cuz of course I guess oay  chased you on the like second base got  you on a kill on Bush yeah we don't talk  about  that we don't talk about that from that  point forward your comes like give me  all Sid lanes and farm at that point  yeah um it's especially important on the  fourth Q evolve so 225 sacks it was like  a dragon fight I think Third Dragon or  something it was uh pretty game changing  I got it like midf fight so then we  actually it contribut to winning us the  fight sweet I appreciate the tips thanks  again you're for sure going to be on  this stage again we got 100 in TL next  thanks guys have a good one thank  you  [Music]  apprciate  [Music]  [Music]  B so welcome back y'all we got a little  Caster swapo in time for game three it's  your boys ra and Asel once back again  and as we get ready for this draft we  saw our first whe and smolder picks in  the LCS with some Crazy Fire coming  between both teams but now with 100  thieves and Team Liquid on the horizon  here one of the things we have to look  at right away is that before when they  first met up in the very first week of  the LCS we had high expectations for  team open against  thev Bo 100 th they saw what dign TOS  were cooking they're like we cannot  allow this through the draft guys yeah I  was hoping we were going to get cast  molder game cuz I've been playing a fair  bit of this champ and I think it is  really really strong it is definitely a  lot of fun to watch on 143 first week of  it it's going to be a banger yeah but as  I was saying before 100 thieves the  first time they met up against Team  Liquid they were talented as the not  favored team and they completely came  back against Team Liquid and showed us  that that these guys have a lot more  than what they're were really perceived  to be before the season started  absolutely I mean at the end of the  first round robin 100 thieves they are  tied for second place way above where  everyone had them in this standing so it  is really exciting we got some fans from  Korea for respect  they here for the Fearless Admiral oh my  goodness the general himself we'll see  how TL is going to be doing today uh  it's going to be a fun matchup I think  you know between these two teams impact  and sniper this was our season opener  here uh these two players going up  against each other it was the blind pick  Riven I believe it was uh game if we  remember counter it was counter pick  excuse me up against the impact I  believe that was one of the only losses  he actually had on the uder he was  playing into the uder was a game thatl  was winning able to bring it back with  some really great double TP plays some  good flanks that were able to turn  things  around but no uder for uh impact in this  one and uder has just been going crazy  in the LCS coming into this week it was  10 and two in the LCS it was basically  every win for TL was impact playing on  uder this guy had been playing it every  single time it's up he is going to be on  the Cante this time around and Yan will  get his hands on the kalista which is  really high pry going to be interested  to see if it's going to be a lane  pairing you know more those range  supports alongside it or if it is going  to be more of an aggressive kind of old  school engage style that we used to see  a lot more and something that we've  already seen patter liquid in the past  games losses were when they try to go  for more early Focus game strats trying  to prioritize solution and just try to  steamroll the game those didn't really  work out in their favor the games that  they have won a lot of late game  priorities so this one Team Liquid they  don't want to just be identified as well  if we don't scale then we we lose right  so Team Liquid trying to have a little  bit more of that early game pressure and  try to prove against the 100 thieves  that they can actually beat them with  something that is proactive early yeah  see with the smolder record tracker on  on the poster in the in this what I want  to see is can you track the stacks you  know be a hard poster to update' be hav  to put a lot up there but we are getting  the vi and tiia tiia buffed on this  patch uh we saw energy running this  combo earlier did not work out that well  for him but I do think it's a great  answer to kalista kalista when you are  on that un Earth if you are hopping  around you it is very very difficult um  you know you can get locked down by that  by point and click engage try to flip in  that kalista burst her down if you try  to use a q or anything like that as the  kalista on that unraveled Earth you are  going to get stunned up um you know with  that little hop from the que y um also  obviously you know ver pretty strong  later here so maybe seeing some of these  potential jungle pairings getting banned  away or rather support pairings uh the  Olaf going to get taken away from sniper  we saw one game I believe from him it is  something that a lot of Pros who are  comfortable playing these aggressive  matchups do really like as one of those  into Cante it is something that you can  run over obviously you have a lot of  true damage on the E U but you can kind  of just really brawl very very heavily  with the Cante and you can kind of just  run this guy down Cante you know is  definitely I think a lot weaker these  days than some of the 1 V ones Kobe our  volar one trick in the house made it all  the way to Grand Master last season yeah  true shout outs to Kobe man grinding on  a champion that most junglers would  never ever pick in this meta or you know  maybe for quite some time a lot of  movement speed items are gone but as we  close out this second draft phase and I  want to highlight for 100 thieves as you  already pointed out this VI to Lea combo  is going to be a huge huge threat for  team liquid's carries not just kalista  as well but for Oriana because that  season assist easy combo to lock in for  the toa's Full Burst I want to see what  team liquid is going to round out this  composition with I imagine that if you  want to go for that lame pryo you want  to go for something like an enchanter  support for cor JJ yeah it absolutely  could do that but Nas also really is  very powerful you know these sorts of  pairings do give you that hard engage  this is kind of what the old school way  of playing kala was people would always  pair it with Nautilus or Alistar or  these types of hard engage picks  nowadays they've been playing a lot more  with enchanters Rana I always think is  kind of that best pairing with it but it  is Band Away uh said dwani looking like  that'll be the lock so going to give  themselves a little bit more time to  decide what they want for that counter  pick down in bot Lane if you're trying  to win the 2v2 you want to see what  support Hunter thieves are going to be  going towards Hunter thieves obviously  need their Top Lane they need their  support so they're going to have to make  some decisions here maai support is  still quite strong on this patch um and  there's a tiny tiny chance of it playing  top I've been seeing a couple people  mess around with the Top Lane again uh  but I think if it gets locked it's  almost 100% chance going to support yeah  we'll have to see what 100 theves last  pick of the the draft is to make sure  but if it were something like a maai it  would add on to how many point and click  tools you have to lock something  slippery down like this kalista which to  be honest close so far it is going to be  the most consistent damage threat that  Team Liquid have in their pocket so hro  going to be the pick here for Sniper hro  Sante pretty solid matchup uh you can  definitely scale well into this you know  generally is considered to be pretty  strong in a tanks you have a good amount  of sustain it's difficult for tanks to  kind of wear you down on their own uh we  have been seeing HX do really poorly uh  in the LCS this split but largely it has  been into uder which is just such a  strong early laner that even though at  TRX is considered good in tanks you kind  of just lose to udor anyway it's not the  same story here with Cante uh so I do  think it's going to be a preferential  match up for Sniper up in the Top Lane  and we have Alistar as the pick here for  Aya so looking for a little bit of hard  engage there more setup for that toia  you're not just going to be relying on  that V ultimate the engage can come  through from Alistar set up things like  the Veris ultimate the Varys q and flips  in as well CJ if he goes back to T this  is something that he was actually really  well known for this was back to the  double LIF days when he was playing with  double LIF they did a lot of I want to  say it was Sonic um one of the kind of  first bot Lanes in our league that we're  doing a lot of that and we're going to  get the tri pick here this is first of  the split I believe for definitely four  core and I want to check if it's first  at like total I'm going to double check  on that but uh this is something that he  is very comfortable with it's a really  strong scaling support it's very very  powerful as well you know with that  kalista um to be able to have that  ultimate in you give you that safety to  go aggressive you use that car ultimate  offensively ideally so you try to start  out the fight you try to look to get  really high value from that especially  against a team that has really  telegraphed hard engage as soon as the V  starts flying in VI can't cancel that  and say just kidding ter presses are and  as long as you keep you alive you could  potentially with good timing deny that  whole VI to Le a combo that they've been  drafting for so really excited to see  how they're going to play this out the  weakness of course is that trick is not  a super strong laner you don't have a  lot of presence in Lane but that being  said against melee supports like the  Alistar as long as you're getting those  Autos out for the passive cooldown  reduction to be able to get more heals  more ease out uh you can still have  quite a bit of value right and I I have  to say the pivot from Nautilus into  Alistar for AA gives a little bit of  flexibility as well because normally  once you go in with Nautilus you're also  kind of in there with Vai but with  Alistar if you want to just punt someone  away or knock us someone as they go in  for the entrance that is at least some  peeling ability that you'll have and  it's more flexibility for this over 100  th composition but as you pointed out  Cosmic radians on the side of core JJ  great timing on that can deny so much  burst and that early burst of damage  from the side 100 thieves as they look  for the initial pick which allows for  that second fight to be super successful  for them absolutely and I did check it  out to confirm it is not only the first  T pick of the LCS is the first T pick  this season of any of the top four major  regions so no one has picked it yet so  another one LCS has been really popping  off with so many different unique picks  this year it has been really fun to  watch and corejj going to add another  one to the list here with the T and  we're heading on into game hundred  thieves versus TL week four the LCS you  know what we got a shout out Mark Z once  again thank you kamish it is solely  because of you we are getting tck in  this game there's no other reason I  refuse to believe it as yep and if they  lose direct all complaints to the markz  on Twitter his DMS are open on Twitter  loves  that all right as we take to the rift  first opening seconds of the game  nothing too fancy here it's just a  defensive line of scrimmage from both  sides maybe quid goes in for a little  bit of poke here but it's just the  standard emote game from APA he throws  up the ton and quid will look for the  reset yep quid going to be looking for  that  reset um it's going to be really  interesting to see how he actually  performs on this till again you know as  I mentioned did get some Buffs on this  patch they're going to help a lot with  the push the base damage on your Q went  up which is very significant you know  even though it is only a small number it  was increased by about 10 I believe um  because you were spimming it out it's  very significant and also the E coold  down got flat reduced to I believe 14 at  all ranks now um so the wave clear is a  lot better and when TOA can get out of  Lane it is so impactful to be able to  move around the map to really be able to  make things happen so going to be  interesting to see you know who gets  push is it still going to be the oron as  you would expect previous patch or will  those Buffs have have shifted things  enough that quid could actually be the  one getting push yeah and to kind of  scope it out here aale I know there is a  lot of things to talk about narratively  for both of these teams especially from  what we saw in that first round robin  match but where are you kind of looking  at first in these few openings I think  you're going to be watching bot Lane you  know I do think these bot lanes are are  going to be pretty spicy uh anytime you  have kalista if it gets ahead of the the  pace of the game it's going to be  important um but we also have to be  looking up towards Top Lane you know  that Riven the first time around that I  talked about this was sniper and impact  in 2016 in 2016 this is a 10-year-old  sniper and this was not the career debut  for impact by the way he played and his  debut was back I want to say was a 2012  or 2013 in Korea so sniper would have  been like six when impa started playing  pro league which is crazy to think you  also have to give so much respect over  to impact it's not just that he's been  playing for a long time this guy has  been dominating at the top level for so  long has won so many championships has  won championships on three different  rosters I want to say in the LCS alone  has gone to International continued to  keep that level of play up so it is so  cool to have you know one of our  absolute greatest veterans in the entire  game not even just in the LCS this guy's  been so good for so long and then he is  going up against sniper one of the  absolute youngest players this kind of  rising star who has so much promise and  it'll be really fun to see who comes out  on top of this because you impa was very  confident that sniper wasn't really  going to be able to do much of anything  against him last time but sniper came  out on top so impact definitely is not  going to be wanting to lose again yeah  the exciting contrast and it shows how  long our esport has been around for the  fact that you can have someone like  impact with such a 10ar career now  playing against someone who has been a  hyped up prospect that we've known about  since he was 12 13 years old first  hitting Challenger and when upon making  his debut guys he picked Riven against  impact and won and he won now refused to  elaborate ref you know what you're right  refuse to elaborate let the results uh  dictate um but it's definitely it's  definitely wild it's it's been  interesting right because I think that  when we've talked to a lot of the top  laners they're like yeah sniper's not  that good you know they're not that that  impressed by him you know but his his  stage results I think have been speaking  for themselves I think he's doing a lot  better than people were expecting U most  people that I were talking I was talking  to you know prior to the split were  saying yeah he's going to have a rough  start you know he he's not there yet we  think he could get there but he's not  there yet and it's going to be a tough  uh beginning of his career in the LCS  you know maybe should have taken another  split in academy or something like that  but here he is and he is performing on  stage you know has been doing well yeah  and I'll put myself on blast I was in  that camp where I was like man they are  bringing in Sniper a little way too  early I'm wrong guys I put 100 thieves  at seventh in this preseason power  rankings I was also wrong my bad also  shout out to David shock who put me on  blast as well it's like it's okay like  100 thieves came with a Vengeance and  they are really pulling a high so far in  this first season uh first round robin  record yeah absolutely it's it's also  fun you know just talking about the Top  Lane there's so much to talk about  because they have such a different style  these two players right in the Shar  champion pool very little share between  these two players just like Cante in  fact in fact has been you know very much  back to the tanks a lot of talk about  how strong tank itemization is in this  season King of Rooker frozen heart you  know plushes bomy that has become kind  of the big three that every tank is  rushing for uh and impact has kind of  been you know having that recipe for  Success where over on the other side  it's very clearly more towards that  aggressive play different style of  Champions coming out from sniper that's  the style that he has kind of made made  his own and uh what he really wants to  be known  for First 5 minutes have passed both the  little grubbies as well as the first  dragon has spawned neither jungler has  made an inclination to really play for  it quite yet but most of the push has  been favoring 100 thieves so far after  this last shove in but there's a moment  where they're looking for a reset do  Team Liquid want to try and find the  dragon here it looks like they are going  to you know especially if that bot Lane  does reset I have to say though Yan is  basically tapped on Mana as well River  now has  that this is going on and it is Hun  thieves with the bot Lane push right now  cor is going to make the first move over  here but again Yan basically out of Mana  completely um m is imp parity this might  just be a bit of a flip but it does look  like Hunter theves have made a decision  no APA is going to be moving down and  that will force them to back off yeah  APA getting that first shove was super  crucial for Team Liquid because as you  called out Yan was not high on combat  power at the time but having that four  versus three potential Advantage secures  in the dragon and because River  committed that time over wait a minute  they might look for something here on  the bot Lane if he wants to look for Q  and Flash not going to commit it just  going to play cool yep and river is  there to cover so you know had he  overcommitted like that trying to go for  a q flash W uh likely would have been  really heavily punished here quid trying  to push up potentially going to look for  an angle to stop that recall but APA far  enough back that it won't be able to  happen and quid just going to be trying  to clear out this wave as fast as  possible he knows he needs to hover his  bot Lane they know River could be around  and River's going to show river is still  charging up the que but as soon as shows  River decides not to engage this is  really tricky cuz as you already it as  once either VI or Sani commits if they  cannot get out as there's a flash  already in the top side sniper popping  the ultimate as well impact going all  out as well lot of damage sniper wins  the 1 V1 what a flash there from sniper  as well impact tried to knock him back  into the tower and try to look for that  Alti to go all out and pull him under  the turret but sniper early flashes and  it means that the Cante Al pulls him  away from the tower instead and sniper  just pops the Alti turns it around we  can watch this one more time we've seen  it a thousand times if you've seen it  once it is E4 Q3 try to W him back in  the turret then look for the all out but  that flash meant impact is going the  wrong way he's low he doesn't have the  assistance that he was counting on from  the tower and this is just great stuff  here from sniper slams him down for the  isolated First Blood there in the Top  Lane and he is looking happy about that  he's almost shocked he's like oh my God  I just did that Viper if you're watching  right now I cannot imagine how proud you  are watching your little bro go from  week one super nervous on the LCS stage  now solo killing the same opponent now  in week four I mean their whole family  is just insane at League of Legends the  Viper you know former LCS Pro Crimson  Challenger player sniper now LCS Pro all  three brothers are Challenger uh those  parents just need to have two more kids  then they can have a full LCS Squad  themselves it could definitely be the  angle as team quit are able to secure  the grubs for themselves still forward  in the front line massive shock wave  tries to bring them all in but that  unreel from quit did a lot of damage  already taking down on APA Force The  Flash but the flash committed as well  quid is just cooking up Team Liquid on a  platter as now core JJ and impact are  forced to run but core's not getting out  100 thieves are running away with the  game on this one yeah they are crushing  him it's a three for zero on that top  side after already getting this solo  kill up in the Top Lane look at sniper  now picks up another kill two assists as  well well as TL we trying to commit very  heavily to this but they don't have a  lot of damage here it's really just APA  and three tanks so all 100 thieves had  to do is keep APA out of the fight the  shock wave was big but at the end of the  day this is an early game Oriana and  then you see this turn as soon as the  APA steps forward for that shock wave he  just gets aled by river river had held  that the entire time waiting for him  knowing that Oriana was the only true  threat with him eliminated there's  nothing the rest of the squad can do and  they're looking happy about it 100 th  cruising early on in this game already a  quick replay of both of the young solo  laners from 100 thieves popping off and  having a good time and I just have to  say it might have been a mismanage I'll  hold up another fight on the top side  sniper now 2v one I don't think he's  getting out of this one with a little  bit of help impact gets the shutd down  yeah nice gake there up on the top side  Mt going to get up towards Top Lane and  this time as you say they're going to be  able to burst him down I think sniper  likely was sitting on a fair bit of gold  as well we'll see if he does actually  have a buy yeah he's sitting on 11100  more gold so close to that that one item  completion so even though uh you know he  is up a lot in Gold he's not at that  full combat power po JJ and Y still have  flash so they're still safe I thought it  looked like maybe River was going to try  to all in with that cease and assist but  they have enough distance to get away  yep going to be able to cleanse and walk  it out so the profane Hydra now  completed you know that's the item that  you're kind of waiting for it is so  powerful on the H rocks really on a lot  of Champions we've talked about it a lot  but because it has that bonus damage on  the active below 50% HP be any Champion  with a lot of upfront burst it's very  easy to knock your opponent in these  trade patterns down and then try uh-oh  AP doesn't have Flash from that grub  fight before easy combo for the to to  follow up shock wave tries to P them  back but he's still dead and gone three  straight kills now for quid three Z and  one on the Tia looking good showcasing  the power of this combo and that is  something I want to say you know river  is so good at is punishing missing cool  Downs if you think back to that last  game as there there's a skirmish here I  think core maybe can walk it out hey he  might have the flash here it's the fat  call from Yan that keeps him safe and  keeps the Summoner spell intact that was  actually so close though he really held  that ultimate long and another flip in  there from quidd he is just kind of on  fire right now but think zingle one here  so far it feels like it oh God  okay Aya igniting his former B Lane Duo  just saying n buddy you can't back there  where did Hong come to  that's crazy I didn't even know he was  here with that with that priority  thieves are just going to be able to get  this second dragon of the game  absolutely but I really want to touch  back on on the first game that they  played against each other it was River  on by it was AP on Zig and he punished  him so badly on the missing Summoners  quid may have to be flashing out of this  situation we'll see already using the  prison there River engages cor JJ  flashes back but the [ __ ] gradient pops  but Team Liquid don't have another way  to engage so theves just get out yeah  exactly and again this game you know  River now on that top side they fight  over by the herald in trouble oh but  nice from Impact using the allout to  dodge that last Q3 from sniper he's able  to survive for now oh pulling him back  in the tower but no turret shot no  punish man this is a really Scrappy game  you know anytime I try to talk about it  another fight breaks out that's the life  of the color Caster go um but yeah RI  River's just into Incan at actually  punishing missing cool Downs CU that's  that's kind of the tldr he did it in the  previous game between these two teams  was able to do it here again you know  forced out the flash from APA with his  ultimate at the herald fight got the  kill anyway then immediately goes back  mid kills him again before flashes up  this is something this guy is really  well known for when you're talking to  these other Pros he is so frustrating to  play against um because he really  understands the gank timings very very  well knows exactly when he can drop  camps uh when he can actually make these  moves to make something happen  here with that priority both already  gained from mid lane you get the grubs  for free on the side of 100 thieves so  it denies Team Liquid from getting all  six as we're going to get a chance to  look at our Kia multi Lane on both mid  jungle and bottom Lane Yan and core  having successfully push meech off of  the tower because Alo went for a ro to  cover mid lane during that time so it  looks like they at least get one turret  plate out of it but the grubs are  awarded over to 100 thieves yep going to  be able to trade the grubs for that so  not that big a deal you lose a plate on  bot side yon has not really been  accelerated too much he's actually going  for a pretty defensive build here as  well you know did go for the early  tabies uh knows that it is going to be  you know likely vers by hro all kind of  rushing down towards him engage from a  do they really want to take this one  chain of Corruptions already as well but  it's the teleport coming in it's double  teleport to Zale both sniper and quid  are arriving to the party a 4v2 on bot  Lane yon tries to pull in cor The Flash  it's not enough quid takes him out both  100 thieves youngsters they're flashing  forward to follow sniper and quid  instant response that flash out from Yan  they're able to burst him down and going  to be able to get a nice punish here  take at least one plate away and there  could be an angle for red but they're  not going to risk it cuz it is that s w  very tanky with the frozen heart already  completed uh small victory on the top  side as it will be a play going the way  of impact to punish that TP down towards  botside from sniper but you hun thieves  again going to be feeling really happy  about this to the carries from TL just  feel like they can get no purchase in  this game you know it's 0 to0 for APA uh  the kalista on the Bots side has not  really been able to get the kind of  pryal that they wanted has not had that  lane dominance that they wanted so both  these guys have been put pretty far  behind and now this Rift Herald fight  Team Liquid are down cool Downs whereas  100 thieves the only one that could be  exposed here is quid which is already  why he is taking a defensive posture on  that left lane no flash Yan so that's  who they may be going for he's going to  have to position well let's see Yan is  already stepping up trying to see if he  can stack these the help for that spere  but as you called it out Aya is flanking  around APA has to guard and meanwhile  Rift Herald is secured by team liid but  now they pincered here as long as APA  can guide them out safely AA still  looking for the flank angle cor JJ  popping the COS radi all on the sniper  they cannot take any burst but now the  cosic radiance is gone but they're still  doing enough damage as they take out  meech sniper in the middle of all five  cannot get anything done River's going  to be next no one Falls from Team Liquid  they survive man the ter ultimate from  CJ was massive for TL in that fight AA  had the flank angle but the Alti lands  from core before he can actually get the  combo off they keep alive and it bought  so much time for Yan in this fight APA  does a good job marking a on the B side  of the screen but then watch the timing  here as it comes down the shock wave is  there that CC's up sniper Yan survives  right before that combo comes through  he's able to cleanse he's able to kite  back he's able to burst them down on the  other side impact as well was going  crazy in the all out it's all down to  that t timing if you hard engage with t  having that ultimate available you have  to be certain that you're going to kill  them before the T Al does fall in this  case hun thieves not able to do it and  TL from a deficit punish them hugely  getting a couple kills there for Yan so  not only does he complete that blade of  the Run King he's now got you know some  extra gold to boot going to be working  towards you know very likely um you know  rage blade yeah that first grub fight  100 thieves thought by taking the fight  at Rift Herald it was just a thought  thinking it was a rehearsal dinner for  them but Team Liquid showing what  happens when you actually have your  ultimates available for that fight and  how the composition is supposed to be  played out so now having experienced the  brunt end of that side 100 thieves have  to be a little bit more calculated of  when they are choosing to go in and  waiting out those cool Downs yeah  absolutely I mean you have to be perfect  with those engages you if you can nail  it you know there's not that many  threats over on the TL side if you get  that perfect initial engage you kill off  yon or you kill off APA there's probably  not enough damage in the tank you know  from that TL Squad to be able to win  through imp back in Sniper trading  heavily here river is going to find cor  JJ looking for the Dazz with the flash  the guaranteed right on top of it quid  is in there as well Weaver wall but Aya  is buying time on Y and APA Yan calls  over core JJ with that face call get the  two man knock up as well looking for The  Dazzle stun river right on top of Y no  damage to follow up sniper looking for  it but Y is cing around he's safe AP is  also safe Team Liquid running away with  the fight once again quin's in trouble  he's gone Team Liquid are smurfing on  100 thieves Y is starting to take over  these last couple fights the cool Downs  haven't been there from hun but it feels  like they're kind of halfhazard forcing  the play anyway you know we saw River  going with the ulti but there's no flash  on quid there's no flash on sniper  sniper didn't even have his ultimate to  try to follow up they can't get to the  backline and actually get these kills  and things are really starting to fall  apart here 400 thieves after what was an  incredible start out of nowhere they're  now down 2.5k they're down a dragon here  and it's starting to look pretty tough  for this 100 thieves Squad who had a  brilliant beginning to this game we can  watch this fight one more time uh this  flash for the stun from core was a  little bit surprising to me you know  looking for that Dazzle stun because yon  isn't really in position to follow up  quck comes in with the Alti they try to  just kind of Zone him out but then look  at that kind of miscoordination there AI  is flashing over the Tia Al to try to  get the combo on Yan but quid is going  for someone else he's not ready for that  he's not going for the flip in for that  seismic shove they have to be on point  with this then when sniper arrives he  doesn't even have his ulti he used it  down in bot Lan when he was scrapping  with impact so these core coold Downs  that you're dependent upon as his bur  composition are missing and the  coordination the communication was not  there you know a and quid of two  different Minds in that fight had Yan  been flipped in off that flash combo  from Aya it could look completely  different Yan being unchecked in this  fight we talked about it in the draft  phase that you have to look at this  kalista to being the most consistent  damage dealer if he's gone if he's taken  out early on then it's an easier win for  100 thieves but the fact that Yan  remains alive now puts more onus and  agency 400 these like really execute  these combos together yeah you have to  be perfect from this position especially  because you know Yan if he realizes the  only way that they can actually lose is  him getting 100 zero he can just go  Shield bone a he can start going really  kind of more tanky defensive itemization  doesn't have to necessarily maximize DPS  cuz everyone over on the 100 thieves  side is pretty squishy you don't like  you don't need a super high damage build  to deal with any of those those  teammates so uh I do think you can start  to look to go pretty tanky just make  sure you're not getting 100 to zero look  for those sorts of plays we could see  things like Knights vow coming out from  core we could see things like locket  coming out from core you just build  towards making sure they can't one shot  yawn and TL I think are going to be in a  pretty good spot so hun thieves are  going to have to make sure they are  absolutely on point in these next couple  fights when it does happen they've got  to be crisp with the engage they've got  to make sure that they're communicating  ahead of time to know when someone's  going to go in you know a has to be  saying I'm going to be looking for for y  on in this next flash hold your seismic  shove  yep almost 20 minutes into the game gold  lead in Advantage for Team Liquid by  3,000 looking for ya oh he tried to  perfectly cleanse it not quite so the  route is enough time for River to get in  range and look for the cease and assist  y just might be in trouble here still at  the flat waiting until the very end of  the cosmic radius it's going to keep him  alive AA tries P him in they finally  take out ywn can this fight be one from  100 at this point it's now up to apa to  see if he has the damage to be able to  last longer but quid already Falls what  can APA do here he's being kept back by  sniper as he is marking him and  preventing any more damage from Team  Liquid to come on in River now isolating  core JJ doesn't hit the Q but aa's there  to follow up with the knock up and core  JJ will fall yeah and the question is do  they go for anything more here with this  do they try to push for the tier one top  doesn't look like it just yet they are  just going to be taking the Scuttle  reclaiming submision we can watch this  one more time as Yan stepping forward  looking for an angle for the 1 V one  here against meech but he gets slowed up  by the ha L Aros slightly early on the  cleanse honestly didn't make much of a  difference I think that river is going  to get in range regardless here with the  Alti but then you can see the Bastion  shield with the w flashes forward gets  the Q heal as well from the T it does  come down that has got to be like 10 HP  okay 45 HP is what I see there in the  bottom left but at the end of the day AA  headbutts him back into the team Mee  gets a shut down sniper is there with  the Alti they have the cool Downs you  know quid getting locked up by that Alti  from umpt was really well placed they do  get a kill back on the other side but at  the end of the day they're just too  light on the damage it was only APA to  really be able to put out any pressure  and he wasn't going to be able to do it  at this point in the game and you can  just see we've already talked about it  before but this fight the state of this  game has been so hinged on whether Yan  is alive or not at the beginning of the  fight as impact might be picked off here  out already popped the ghost trying to  speed on out maybe he gets out of this  one wow he is a tanky boy so impact is  going to survive this one but that is  down a Summoner spell now in the next  couple of minutes actually under a  minute this next dragon will be spawning  and not having that cool down maybe it  doesn't hurt Team Liquid at the most but  it's going to make him less mobile yeah  is it is definitely you know impactful  in some of these fights uh at the same  time they did get Mee's Al out you know  had he died right before Baron or right  by Baron maybe they go with in trouble  AA right onto Yan but the COS of  gradians is there to guarantee no burst  will come throught is front loading all  the damage as well stunning up quid  meanwhile they find Yan onto the  backline but there's no damage to follow  up Yan is still alive AA trying to keep  him busy but AP is winning the fight for  Team Liquid while Yan is being kept busy  sniper wins one on the impact andp River  now still alive barely playing on an HP  this one not really going convincingly  to either side I mean it looked like it  was going to go heavily to TL but that  seismic shove from quid gets them two  kills there catching both Mt and impact  and now they're going to try to go for  Baron starting up on the other side does  TL actually make the move they're  starting to move but it's very late  they're going to leave yawn to finish  off the dragon a sniper dies to the  baron river is also super low he might  the bar Riv going  to the shield the healing is going to be  enough one more they can it it's a heist  baby and 100 theves are out of there oh  my God I thought they were going to have  to bail out for sure but they had good  enough Vision spotting APA the APA could  not get there in time to punish they do  lose sniper to the neutral and TL are  able to get a dragon on the other side  so they're going to be one off soul on  Soul point now but it's a good risky  move here from hun th toble to get  something back and let's watch this one  more time again it's all about can you  coordinate on the initial play Flash  Forward there from M but there's no  seismic shove available because umpty is  marking quid really good tank play here  fromt you know recognizing it's not the  threat of the engage I have to mark it's  the threat of the followup I have to  mark so he goes forward he gets the ulti  down on quid Quinn can't land that  seismic shove that one's not on him this  one he does nail which was really a bail  out because TL look at their health they  were crushing this fight they would not  have been able to get that bar without  that beautiful seism shove gets them two  kills they go to top side they do lose  sniper but they get the baron and they  keep themselves very close in this game  as far as gold obviously if you give  over ocean soul to a Sani trick as well  as Zante you're probably going to lose  the game um but at least they have an  opportunity here to look for those  fights a might be caught here no flash  available there's the stun from the  Perma Frost into the glacial prison Aya  using the ultimate to damage ruce all of  it River coming over the wall quit can  he find this iic shove onto the priority  Target it's on the core JJ that's not  really ideal river is going to be  falling for that one impact making sure  that sniper can't get into the fight  either all out still available but not  needing it as he's going to be able to  kite this one now Team Liquid taking the  away the advantage that they already  took out River five on Four Strong in  the map I mean river is just way too far  behind to be any sort of a solo threat  onto on so there he finds the Q on ywn  but there's an immediate lock it an  immediate W Shield there from the T as  well plus the heal comes through they  never going to be able to H zero this  guy before the ultimate comes down so he  has to use the ultimate actually to  retreat to try to get back over the TOA  wall to try to get out of there but  there was no ability to really follow up  and if they can't threaten yawn they  clearly cannot win these fights we've  seen it time and time again you know  quit had a pretty good angle over the  wall looking for that seismic shove but  it was still into that t ultimate so  nothing really came of it and TL are  going to be able to win another fight as  corejj passes exal for n most assists  all time special definitely one of the  early legendary players in the LCS you  know his days with TSM remembered very  fondly by  many I even for a brief time too on Team  Liquid it came over when they were still  cursed and then rebranded over to Team  Liquid shout out to Alex Che as Team  Liquid going to be posing up here ready  to see what waves they can catch and see  if they can look for another pick here  AA still doesn't have Flash and he was  an easier Target for them to get last  time and that baited H thieves into that  fight every single time Team Liquid have  been playing so well around the cosmic  Radiance timing his impact ghing in  looking for an engage was ready to go  for Mee with that all out but Aya there  just making sure that he is marked and  impact does not find the pick yeah  impact know there's no point in going  for anything too risky the game really  is going in their favor so you don't  need to to roll the dice on something  like that right you know take only the  high percentage plays uh you can see  this is pretty questionable I'm not  going to lie Mt uh going for a heal cut  here oh the  execution the Executioner Sani it's a  little bit sus I'm I'm not going to lie  I mean the W does physical damage so  like it's not the worst thing impact  though might be in trouble The All Out  brings it right back with the infernal  chains that's a pick for 100 thieves and  going to Barr down mid lane yep well  we'll see Mt on the side here poking  away it's a great pick you can see  Hunter thieves pushing up Top Lane with  theia pushing in mid lane after that  kill on impact impact feeling a little  bit too confident you know sitting alone  against four under that Tower yes you  were tanky but you are not that tanky  you're not really aheading gold in fact  they are now down a couple thousand gold  after these couple Towers did fall 400  thieves so it's going to be all about  the setup here you know trying to  prepare themselves for this big fight  potentially you know you look on the  mini map look at all these Wards liter  in this entire area TL trying to  dominate Vision in that section of the  map really making sure that they are the  ones who are going to have all this info  around this next dragon flight uh it is  going to be coming up here pretty soon  and we'll see if they can dominate that  area because they get ocean soul they  probably just straight up win the game  and hun thieves are going to have to try  to reclaim vision and shout out to The  Observers showing that it's pure  Darkness for the side of 100 th walking  in could just be face they have to wait  for quid they can't just walk up because  even if it's someone tanky doesn't get  one shot you need your whole team there  to follow up so they're waiting for quid  coming out of Base they saw APA bot Lane  so now I think they're going to feel  confident to push through mid then walk  down to the river and try to reclaim  Vision that way uh you can see impact is  trying to hold that mid lane wave but if  he's shown there again you can try to  walk in with this fiveman squad yeah and  you you have the the number advantage  for the moment you just have to wait on  impa to be able to colle that  wave let's see here going get engaged on  by first SI catches core River trying to  front load and Mark impact on the other  side Yan and APA separated from the rest  of the front line so not much damage is  being traded right on back quid  maintaining this posture aggressively as  tries to get back into this banana brush  impact walking back on over as the  dragon stacking has begun with these Ren  Stacks from ywn Impact trying to see if  he can look quid weever comes in too  late as you called it as they already  use the glacial prison as defensively  But Here Comes sniper trying to look for  a flank but R War dictates flank on the  weakest side of the flank here cosic R  is going to be popped up as yon can now  dash aggressively in meanwhile they're  trying to turn on back but sniper is  going to be waiting in the wings as well  but yon turns right on back once again  but they've already lost dty in the  fight Team Liquid just have to pick to a  side and commit they cannot be just just  getting pulled apart in both of these  sides as H thieves have now marked up  for death River might go down to impact  it's one back over to Team Liquid but  quen with the flash finds APA Aya dis  engaging and being able to find APA as  well on the back end of it as well  thieves take a fight in their own yeah  quidd is going to be able to find a big  pick there on AP they get both the  carries they were too slow on the engage  here they were trying to buy so much  time they were waiting for Sniper who  was coming around from below the fight  but it was very difficult to fight past  the Oriana ball we see the snipers  trying to come in from the bot side but  it's all about Oriana zoning people out  on the other side once APA moves back  into this kind of area you can see  everyone from under Thief is able to  pile forward AA stepping up me is  stepping up quidd is stepping up they no  longer have that zone control and then  this Flash in so good from Aya catches  out Yan they burst him down they know  they need to get more they gave up ocean  soul which is massive and that ocean  soul regen paying dividends for imp back  already but then this Flash Forward from  quid APA trying to S side step it can't  quite get it earns them another kill so  they still have a chance in this game  but they know it is going to be really  difficult from this point three tank  items completed there for impa on the  top side two and a half done for umpty  and corejj there as well you know going  to be getting tankier and tankier it's  going to be so difficult to actually  punch through not only the initial kind  of damage that they have to get out but  now the ocean soul regen like if you  don't kill off Yan right off the bat he  can heal up a fair amount in that ocean  soul during the T ultimate that's extra  regen that is all more Health you're  going to have to be dealing with and he  has the wits end now so he has the  additional resistances from there with  that bf very likely could just be a BT  last you know really just trying to make  sure he's staying  alive 100 thieves a huge obstacle that  they have to overcome against ocean soul  Team Liquid they are ahead in Gold yes  but as you already pointed out yon is  going to be so tough to kill the raid  boss but quid this guy has leveled up so  much since his first split in the LCS  last summer so much more confidence from  this guy as he is is flashing  aggressively in these fights he doesn't  have Flash up for this next potential  fight but if there is Magic that can be  made it will be from this guy's hands  yeah absolutely and he does have that  Melo so they do have some sort of heal  cut at the very least uh Mel is  obviously a pretty cheap buy now so you  can kind of tech into that more easily  but that really is their only heal cut  right now and river does get stunned up  but um's in trouble a finds an engage on  umpty Mech is already done a decent  amount of damage Cosmic Radiance  prevents further burst coming in as  impact Mark sniper Here Comes AO looking  for the on there's the flip from Quin he  finds it once again shock wave is going  toay time but a still goes down Y is on  the left side Quin turns they got him  100 thieves they got both of the carries  and now Team Liquid are running for the  hills but impact is pinned against the  wall as quit finds him once again he  surely will take him out impact maybe  gets out alive at this point but 100  thieves still have five members to push  down for the Nexus yeah that should be  it 100 thieves I think they've done it  the tanks are hard to crack but they cat  jpa they catch y on and they burst them  down 100 thieves in their first match  against Team Liquid at the beginning of  the season so many were skeptical that  this team would not make much in this  season they said it was a heist in the  first week but 100 thieves just might  show that it's not a heist it's a  promise that this roster will deliver in  the spring split as River and the rest  of H thieves carry forward this momentum  looking for the last Nexus Tower they're  running out of minions but they will  persevere through a few more autoex will  do it 100 thieves take the  game 100  thieves another win for this team two  and zero now against TL on the split  starting off week four here with a bang  both their games you eerily reminiscent  of each other it feels like they start  out strong they dig themselves into a  little bit of a hole but then they're  able to come back through their  playmaking they're staying confident  they're staying aggressive and I've got  to say what a game from quid I think he  was incredible today on the Tia this guy  has leveled up massively from last year  we are seeing the promise that people  have been talking about with this guy  and we are seeing the team really step  up around him as well you know Mee  having a great game on the ver 71 and8  only died that one time 92 and8 for quid  as well a lot of the concern around this  100 te's roster was well who's supposed  to be the carry you have all these young  players we don't really know if they're  going to be able to be consistent we  don't know if you can count on them to  get it done when it matters most but  here they were able to do just that  catching APA catching yawn time and time  again the perfect timing there on that  seismic shove as well but we're going to  be heading for a break ahead of shop  fire Bellion versus fly Quest let's see  how fly Quest is doing on are you  smarter  than you guys for us was done drinking  that's cool honestly I felt my throat a  little grappy at the  end get out get yeah wait how did I die  good good good good good that very kind  of  ter you of are you smarter than LCS Pro  next category we're going to talk about  some items we're doing the same thing  again so I'm going to say essentially a  build path and you're going to list as  many items that you can think of that  build from this specific item wow  they're worth one point each oh my God  so Bounty of Worlds builds into five  different yeah yeah yeah the five items  yeah uh dream dream oh he doesn't even  know the first one is blood song yes  that's one dream sleepy dreams good  dreams I know a dream catcher Dream  Maker let's go Dream Maker Dream Maker  there we go he not give it to him oh  it's there's three others then we got  Zach Zack what's the next part of it  come on no no no can I help him or not  you can't help him until he fails and it  bounces back to you so really don't give  me half point for Zach Zack please no  okay we're going to toss it to dig uh  Celestial opposition yes Solstice slay Z  realm Spike oh my God I'm B items all of  them I don't even read the new items I  don't know what the names are I was  hoping for some math questions not leak  questions  all I am going to read you the  description of an item and you're going  to tell me what item it is okay okay  unique hex charg gained 30 ultimate  haste unique overdrive I mean I know we  I me this the one that you buy a nocturn  first it what does it like how is it the  name hex  plat something hex your team your  teammates are dying he gets half a point  at least hexl hex hex PL can I say do  you know what it is experimental hex  plit yes good  job we get half a pointed it's rigged  cuz we set up Tomo we told him it's X  all right unique light Shield strike  your next basic  attack uh cycler no under Sky  yes colossal consumption while within  700 units of an enemy Champion generate  a stack on them each second stacking up  to three  times 30 per Target second cool down out  still yes then know it's hard still I  didn't even know it did off that  stuff that wraps up round two now we're  going to go to a  [Music]  break you  ready no I think so yeah you know just  remember stay in your lane keep your  vision up at all times you know time is  going to be everything here so you don't  want to go too fast but you also don't  want to  be I got  this yeah I think you do  and Mark  thanks whoa hey no no no whoa no you're  not taking my car my Kia ev9 no  [Music]  way no  [Music]  touching  Red Bull gives you  [Music]  [Music]  wings welcome back to the LCS I'm here  with sniper after the win against Team  Liquid and I have to ask you know your  first game in the LCS was against impact  on Team Liquid you did win but it felt a  little shaky here you got a solo kill  against impact how did that feel I mean  it felt amazing cuz I was like really  comfortable on this matchup and I knew I  would do good so when I got that solo  kill I was like I don't know I just so I  I had like so much energy after that you  know but then the energy translated into  just me dying to a gank much  another yeah and also you win yet  another game on 100 thieves you have a  lot of early season success is this how  does the early season compare to your  expectations going in from a team  perspective I think I already talked  about this but before the split I didn't  even think that I was like LCS ready but  when scrim started I started like  practicing more with my team I got  comfortable with the environment and I  started improving like drastically you  know and from then on it's been it's  been amazing that's awesome and it's a  really short regular season you know  after after Tomorrow there's only going  to be two more weeks of regular season  before playoffs what do you what are you  working on now because you're still such  a fresh player to the LCS just to think  ahead and basically just like just  constantly think about the game  sometimes I just autopilot like when I  died to that jungle gang so just being  aware of just everything going around me  at all times you asked me before what I  thought of that game I said it was a  banger game what what did you think  about that game what was other than the  solo kill what were some of the  highlights I was for sure a little  disappointed cuz after I got to solo  kill I was up like 20 Cs and if I just  didn't die to that sigu gank the game  would like have went on so much more  smooth you know so I think other than  that the game was pretty good A lot of  Team fighting yeah last question I  noticed during week one you have the  shirt tuck you still have the shirt tuck  why is that a thing bro this like Jersey  is so big on me by the way look at  this I look like I'm like back to school  you know so like I don't really want to  give up that Vibe I want to be like yeah  I love it it's working for you thank you  very much congratulations on the win  appreciate itk you we're done for thank  you guys thank you  [Music]  [Music]  h  [Music]  Aaron would be pretty good too I would  take I agree with you welcome back  everyone we got Shopify Rebellion going  up against fly Quest here we're going to  be taking on the draft so first thoughts  anyone first first last that's a good  one first place last place now there was  a question I had for our stats guy I  feel like a lot of times you  underestimate the team that's blow you  in the standing so he pulled post week  three all LCS history first place versus  last place including ties which is this  because Shopify was tied for last 60 and  21 oh so that's you know you do the math  about a 70 little bit below a 75% win  rate that still seems pretty high that  still seems pretty high last pry High  yeah that's shocking to me here's what I  won now hit  me boo made a bet it said if he got what  over 10K Twitter followers the pike bet  he was going to walk in  Pike actually and then they released a  thing with nuke duck  yeah here we go why is he going to pick  it again hope you guys are excited to  see  fik  which is really funny after talking to N  duck in the coaches interview last week  where he was like yeah sometimes you  just ask your players if they can play  something and then you figure out if  they can actually play it say yes  essentially um I think luo in general in  terms of him widening his champ pool  we've kind of talked previously about  how he used to be a midlaner um but he  has been a big difference maker in this  fly Quest botling and it's been really  really fun to see him kind of unleash  thus far this place it's interesting  you're talking about fly Quest I mean at  least the champion pool a little bit I  think we can actually talk about the mid  lane Champion pools for both of these  because to me that's the most  interesting thing between Jensen um  going up against Insanity because it's a  pretty wide difference of for what they  actually play there's the Oriana  switching it up so we got the Oriana  wait a minute we got the Oriana for  Insanity Turtle explain what's happening  well we just decided to be a little bit  more traditional now you know we don't  want to be that crazy with the Garen  Zach cion thought we if we played normal  stuff we might actually have a chance to  win this is actually this is actually  great having you here though because you  were on stage for the first two games of  the split with shop fire Rebellion  what's the what's the vibe like from  Shopify in champ select like who is  driving um it's kind of like a group  effort at the moment and Sam kind of  lets us like he puts like fuel to our  fire sometimes like if we suggest  something crazy he'll just let us do it  Sam is Revan yeah sorry Revan our coach  Revan I saw fly Quest hovering that k a  little bit kind of got me worried cuz I  want the kaisa on my  team oh  well let's see if we get it back let's  let's see if we get a back oh my God  yeah actually earlier I want the kaisa  earlier we showed a clip in which MSU  was walking through smolder so like  seems like that's a pick that they've  really clung on to and I mean they've  seen the earlier games Tomo ran a little  bit of a shot top in some of these team  fights he was he was a terror so being  able to see another smolder game is  going to be fun oh Z is pretty solid too  gu the vi Zyra con it up last  second like this is standard are con's  pretty good so far that's what I was  going to say I was like this is the most  standard comp I think I've seen you guys  run I started trying to win  now one of the training weights so so  maybe uh I can't decide whether it's  like that or you're trolling me and  somehow the Ori is going like top or  something no they got Ori time Ariana's  going mid okay so Turtle what's the  match up like with smolder versus z um I  just think it's like a farming L and  then you have the Recon being able to  threaten the smolder so I think it  should be pretty favored to zyon now now  that uh Kraken slay is like extremely  buff speaking of just threatening a pick  we got the azir locked in which is the  idea I'm sure alongside VI is to just  threaten Oriana mid so it's not going to  be that safe also just like azir versus  the short range of z um that being said  I'm reminded of a tweet that Jensen put  out where he said that Ori and air until  it's banned or zir was not banned Orana  was picked so there it is there you go  we're got a classic match up in mid uh  and you see they're not cowards they did  it yeah fly Quest taking out the nocturn  we've seen a variety of Oriana nocturn  combos some successfully some not as  successful uh and taking out Whos Olaf  from the shop fire bellying side Turtle  when you guys are looking at a team like  fly Quest cuz obviously people have to  prepare for stuff that insanity is going  to throw in the mid lane but when you're  looking at fly Quest do you consider  like wipo's Top Lane chample cuz he's  willing to slam a lot of unique picks  there yeah we're always a little worried  about giving him the counter pick but um  I think in this case we're always hoping  to get the uter we did we did not get  that so I wonder what fake gu is going  to do I'm guessing he's going to go for  the at  Tru he is an insane at TR dos player  yeah I think fly Quest will probably  pick the rata on the  four I I actually don't know what pair  is very well smolder yeah well you were  trying to figure that out earlier it's  still because it's such a new Champion I  think I think it will be rata on four  because uh just because I think it's a  good Champion the support match up verus  R more so than the ad carry pairing  would make a lot of sense and I think  boo is also a u a Rado player I mean or  pike pike is not very good but I hope he  picks it I was going to say I don't I  hope I hope he picks it I mean if you're  going to pick a hook champ this is kind  of Pike I mean it's locked he locked it  I'm a little shocked I didn't expect  that so what's your thought on this bot  Lane match up cuz he should have just  pick Pike at this point right I don't  know why he's going for the blitz just  like ruining it for all the fans out  there Wukong ALS brother zil look at  that beard oh my god wow they they can't  hear us can they they can't  respect although I could tell you that  they don't and then I wonder what you  say okay yeah I just said no and then I  was I was there it is the Wukong Boogie  Wukong this is the first time we've seen  it actually I got a couple Buffs I don't  know if it's good I'm still not a fan of  the champion but let's just see I think  those Buffs were more targeted at his  leaning right it was meant to  buff but he's always been such a good  jungler so I expect the atro to be  picked pick a lot of you cowards I feel  like there's a trend with people holding  up uh posters calling people cowards to  pick a champion it's working pretty  Weller honestly true there's the atro  that you expected and honestly shopify's  composition as a whole pretty solid it's  pretty solid very  standard it's  cohesive it looks makesense we got  Oriana pulls it all together there's a  lot of threats from the side of fly  Quest at least with with blitz crank VI  me a lot of single targets so Zia has to  be concerned that's going to be a Cante  being locked in so thoughts so far on  the compositions which ones you guys  favor I like blue side yeah why I I just  have unknown reasons why I  might okay well I I got we got that out  of the way uh we're handing this to the  casters but I've heard that ail has a  score to settle with  boo yep absolutely I mean here's the  thing you know buo tweeted out he said  he was going to play Pike I retweeted it  you know we helped him get the followers  he gain 1 th000 followers but you know  what when you break trusts there has to  be a reckoning here oh no it's coming  boo I told you if you lied if you B  Boozled I'm  unfollowing Allan I fear you have made a  terrible mistake losing the aale follow  that is like losing social credit at the  highest possible he can earn it back  though with a good Blitz game okay okay  cuz Blitz is pretty pretty hype yeah if  he picked like a Lulu that's like a  block you know that's the next step  Blitz earned him only an unfollow cuz he  lied to me but he lied to me with  something cool so yeah we'll give we'll  give him a pass I don't know lying is  still pretty bad is it it's true that's  why he got un followed all right like I  said if it was L he would have got  blocked all right you hear that Allan  you got to earn that trust back from Mr  aale the little world champion himself  yeah I'm I'm I'm excited for this game  really happy to get to cast the smolder  game I've been playing a lot of smolder  I actually think that the the build that  we saw earlier I think is a much  inferior build to what is actually you  know what I think is going to become the  meta is a much more tanky smolder build  I think shojun rush into riff maker  LeAndre is so ridiculously strong this  Champion's range is too short to  consistently stand in Auto attack so you  don't actually get a ton of value out of  really high attack speed that build with  the shojun rush gives you so much CDR  early both of the components and with  the item completion that allows you to  get Stacks really really fast and then  you're building three straight HP items  which allows you to really be pretty  tanky in these fights you turn online a  lot earlier compared to the crit build  as well yeah uh which allows you to have  a lot more kind of activity in these  early fights cuz smolder actually scales  by fighting it is not like you know an  azir or or a kale or whatever where  you're like okay I just got to get XP  and get minions and no the way you get  Stacks faster is by hitting people with  your abilities and the way you can  actually set yourself up for that is by  having you know a really strong early  build and that build lets you get there  uh it also allows you to Tech into a lot  of different angles you know for your  fourth item if you're just having a good  game you're not really threatening you  can go rapid fire you can go BT you can  go damage whatever but you know if it's  heavy physical and you're under threat  you're getting Dove you can go iceborn  if it's heavy magic and you're and  you're getting poked out you can go  kanic like this Champion can become a  brick wall where you're having 4,000 HP  but as long as you get your Stacks  you're still killing everyone it is so  powerful and I'm 100% convinced it is by  far the superior build so I'm really  going to be interested to see if masu  does go for that style or if it is more  what I think was the kind of like  initial jump that everyone did which was  basically just building him like Ezreal  yeah I'm I hope chat was taking all  those notes down because I'm pretty sure  I saw your head expanding literally as  you were just like dropping truth Bombs  all over about this uh other build for  smolder we're going to see though if  masu actually Ops into that or if he  goes for the crit Focus build that we  saw uh Tomo play I know the very first  competitive game smolder uh credit to  Lady Sports and messages from The  Challengers League also ran a crit build  as well I mean it still does damage late  game but I think that's an argument  worth having it's like having more  durability early protects you while  you're getting those Stacks up in first  place and it it's not like the [ __ ]  build is just straight bad like you will  do higher DPS if you're able to Auto  attack but the reality is in almost no  games I've watched wer and I've both  played and watched a lot of it can you  actually stand there and just Auto  attack it almost never happens the range  is very very short there is crit scaling  on the E so some people do kind of make  that argument but I just think it's so  irrelevant compared to uh the Synergy  that LeAndre and Rift has with the flat  damage amp you're going to get and how  tanky it makes you how early you can get  involved in these fights uh it is going  to be a comet smolder here he's playing  ghost flash so we're going to see W  level one pretty much guaranteed and I'm  curious to see how many points he's  going into it most of the pros I know  are are kind of of a mind that you go  three points W in the qax I have seen  when people are going more the build  that I'm talking about some people will  go Five Points W and it becomes really  powerful both for wave clear uh and for  a lot of these fights you the range on  it is very high if you're getting multim  man W's you know with that early Five  Points it is significant damage so uh  there's a lot to learn with this  champion doran's ring definitely the  correct start you know a lot of people  were kind of getting uh baited by going  dblade and is significantly worse you do  need the additional Mana the AP pretty  nice as well so it's going to be a fun  one to watch um also in the game we saw  earlier the smolder Stacks actually came  online very late you know generally uh  we'll see if if it is going to be slower  on average it in Pro because again it's  like even with perfect Farm you really  accelerate your Stacks by fighting right  so if there's less fighting in Pro maybe  the stacks will be slower on average  than uh in Solo que the fastest I've  personally been able to get it is around  17 18 minutes um most of my games I feel  like you know you're going to get it  maybe around like 22 or something but I  I'm not doing it perfect perfectly by  any means um I have heard of a game uh  where I think it was Nemesis apparently  got it in 14 15 minutes that's the  fastest I've heard of that is insanely  fast if you're able to like stack  perfectly there's also a lot little  tricks you can do again I don't know if  people are really going to let you do  them but you can stack off void mites  with your Q you can stack off off the  mini Raptors off the mini kugs like you  can start to onot all those pretty quick  and you can get a ton of extra Stacks if  your jungler is willing to donate those  over to you right so as we pull up our  Kia multi Lane I want to remind everyone  while we're on the live patch and you  know shout out to our Commish Mark Z for  letting us play on the live patch first  before any other major region Champions  when they are enabled are still the same  for every region which is 2 weeks that  is a global rule so there have already  been scrims and practice with smolder in  these past two weeks so we're going to  see how much fly Quest have really  rehearsed coming into their first game  of smolder exactly and also you know on  inverse side how well chop F can punish  um someone else I really want to talk  about is insanity because he has just  been doing such an interesting thing  this split you know bringing out you  know very unique picks he has played all  kinds of different Champions and a bunch  of them are actually ones that really  only he is playing you know if you're  not watching leagues around the world  you may not realize both Garen and Zach  he's the only one in the entire world in  this season not even just major regions  of any pro league including erls Etc  that has played these picks mid lane uh  there's also the Sion he is two out of  the total four picks globally as well in  any League again um to play it so he is  playing some very atypical stuff and  it's been a lot of fun to watch as buio  tries to time his hook with the minion  dematerializer but I think he did a  little bit yeah a little early I like  the the thought process problem with  piig Pike buddy would  you I think it was still the timing of  the I guess the the minion do  materializer but you know what I  sympathize with your plight here as  Boogie true you might have still had  that problem maybe maybe maybe now  Boogie was in the area but not a lot of  diving power with Wukong early on you  bring a lot of damage but no real CC so  just making sure that no one is in the  area and just providing some defensive  coverage in case it's fired ever off of  the reset that is about to go for comes  back bot Lane but Jensen's very low and  Boogie once again not a lot of diving  power on Wukong if you ever see that  then you have to know that it has to be  for a guaranteed kill and Jensen is  still safe in this position Insanity  doing very well though in this 1 V one  you know really has been pressuring  Jensen in these early levels Wukong they  touched on it at the desk did get Buffs  on this patch nice double w there does  connect and that's two stacks knock up  from buio as he KES on back to protect  masu making sure that they're not in the  Flash and B at the very last frame gets  out is going to be able to flash out of  there Jensen really getting lit oh my  goodness the pressure just kind of  non-stop there from sanity zazil going  to be able to stop Theo on that Recall  now you can see masu they want it to  reset and masu is still going to reset  but this means the wave is going to  crash unless Inspire can come hold it at  the very least he's going to lose some  these minions but we'll see can they get  BVO who has no flash yeah no flash  available he might pop the ghost but  they knock up into the Q as guarantees  the damage but B does enough damage with  zil First Blood and now inspir is forced  to flash don't tell me he gets out the  ghost kinding this one out Inspire is  waiting for the que flashes in front to  block it that's teamwork right there  that is a really smart Flash from zazil  if he does not go for that Inspire might  have been able to finish him off but  they try to go for the big play here  they try to look to punish bivy even  without masu there they can't do it he  walks out they give up first Blood  critical though for them it went to  zazil so you are really happy that at  least the first Blood went over to zil  but it's a 1.2k gold Le 1.3k briefly as  it jumped up there um only 5 and2  minutes in that is actually a ridiculous  lead this early on that is telling you  you're winning in farm you also have  that kill go so really really big you  can see dark seal here for masu for a  little bit more early laning power does  have the long sword so we'll have to see  where he's going to go long sword  obviously not telling us a lot uh it  does build into a ton of different items  could be shojun could still be Essence  Reaver um but I'm I'm very curious to  see where he's going to take us and  check on his build let's see what he's  doing so far he is just the two points W  as expected at the very least he's going  to go three and I kind of want to see if  he goes beyond that um after after he  hits level 7 yeah and guys this snot  bubble is going to deal a decent amount  of damage later into the laning phase as  you already see a little bit of that  power with theu as once again the replay  they try to look for the damage but it's  just just not enough once inspired comes  back and just really pristine Flash here  from BVO yeah nice flash does react to  it and then this is post inspired  flashing after him the Q is here just in  time but zil flashes in front support  dip blocks it up and Jensen going to be  forced to actually Shuffle him away as  in sany looks for the sombrero there  trying to connect on him with the alt he  couldn't quite find it that would have  been crazy you know Chef Chalet as degon  uh coined him was looking for a creative  angle there but now that is Jensen's  flash gone so the time Bui pays a visit  and he's going to be level six soon  that's an easy cyclan followup to make  yeah yeah you can hit him with that  Cyclone you know try to get in there  look for that gang setup obviously you  know being able to go into the Clone you  w in with the Oriana ball on you and  then you Nimbus strike for the shock  wave come through it is a really nice  little point of initiation especially if  you're coming out of a brush they don't  see you approaching that can be very  surprising and is that powerful engage  they can be looking for as nice little  flap flap there from masu gets out to  the side that that that fly is is a big  injection of speed but it lasts very  little times you kind of have to be on  point with it but you know as we see it  showcase there masu has the reaction  time be able to step out of it oh boio  might be in trouble here no flash and  there's the Cyclone from Boogie as he  gets ready to throw down the staff and  zil picks up another kill yeah nicely  done they get another kill again  unfortunately goes to zazil there's a  little greedy down on that bot Lane  share the love zazil two kills on the  Recon is the only two kills so far in  this game The W to prep the wave he's  going to look to try to last hit all of  these with the Q once you have 25 Stacks  again it becomes AOE becomes very easy  to just do W into Q on the backline and  one shot that and remember any minion  that does get last hit it's not just the  one that you shoot your Q at uh so if  you have AOE and you get a multiple  minions you get multiple Stacks with the  Q so it's something to remember uh you  really do have to focus on stacking if  you guys want to play this champion at  home and trust me uh even if you know  Pros are playing the crit build it's  definitely a lot easier to play the HP  based build because it's a lot more  forgiving for your positioning yeah yeah  building durability gives you a little  bit more breathing room and larger room  for error as fly Quest trying to prep  this Dragon but Boogie insanity and  zazil are also here 2K on the HP Lucio  with the hook finds zazil the auu gets a  decent amount of damage but zazil is not  in any threat just dances over the wall  and Red Team AKA fly Quest are able to  pick up the dragon yep going to be able  to grab that nice little bit of poke  back as well 49 Stacks now for masu so  not a crazy pace of course it does  accelerate as you get further into the  game uh it is going to be that Sheen by  so it likely will be the essence reever  again unfortunately I really want to see  the other build uh I I'll try to be a  build salesman you know got to go talk  talk to some pros convince him yeah I  was trying to sell tactical on it  earlier but he wasn't he he seemed  intrigued I won't say he was sold well  he definitely witnessed the power  smolder firstand in the the second game  of the day Mom they're pushing my tower  clear the wave please as fly Quest going  to be able to make sure that no more PL  go to the side of shif masu might be in  trouble decent knock up but it's more  damage done to zil than it is done to  masu here yeah not too big of a deal  chuse the ulti to clear that out uh he  is in fact going to three points W into  qax that's basically what we always are  seeing with the essence Reaver build  these days so is going to be going that  kind of more common crit build inspired  obviously just clearing away here on the  top side has been focusing on the camps  is a little bit ahead of the farm as a  result but Insanity here may be getting  caught  out looks like he's fine for now still  has flash Jensen doesn't so he has to be  a little bit more careful about how he  approaches the river here and Sanity  trying to set up an offensive position  in case he does first grub has already  been taken by Boogie and inspired has  flash available BVO is here as well  though and and smoulder is way behind on  the rotation so this should be Shopify  don't think they're going to be able to  contest on the FL Quest side and there's  no dragon to take as they already took  it just a couple minutes ago so full  grubs controlled by shop fire Rebellion  but is going to take this opportunity to  set up some aggressive Vision in this  red side jungle and zil knows he know  that they saw them dip into the fog of  War so now Z on B have to be careful  play through the mid wave the shock wave  is going to connect on the Jensen I  don't think he has flash quite yet he  has to shift on over and he gets out  alive yep going to be okay of course  there's not a lot of AP behind that  shock wave it's a tier and an amone plus  the doran's ring so Lucio oh nice  attempt there tried to time it out  obviously they have that Ward um you up  above as masu just looking for some W  poke here trying to get that WQ again  getting as many stacks as possible every  opportunity that he has and you can see  you know it's it's not as weak of a  laner as as people think you know in the  initial days people were all doing qmax  and they're well this Champion you can't  even Lane it's terrible you know how are  you supposed to get to those Stacks but  they're actually doing quite well in  this 2v2 you he is 15 CS ahead in fact  stacking reasonably well again we'll  have to kind of get a better barometer  for like what a good rate of stacking is  in Pro because it is just a lot less  Scrappy than when you're playing solo  queue and you're just having all these  fights non-stop where you can get a ton  of stacks yeah cuz if you have a long  extended fight where you're just queuing  someone on cool down and hitting  multiple people with your W you can walk  out of a fight with like 20 Stacks no  problem true I still can't get over the  fact that nmas is cut in this is  something that I I I haven't actually  watched the game this is what someone  told me so maybe this is totally fake  May um but I'm going to try to find the  VOD cuz I mean 225 I want see what the  fastest possible is yeah cuz we're about  12 minutes and masu has gone about just  under  so he still has about three more  iterations of this so if we're going at  this same Pace it would take until about  what 33 36 minutes to get there but  obviously maybe if there's more  scrapping towards the mid game he can  accelerate that and it does speed up as  you get more items cuz your your cool  Downs get lower so it's like early early  on in the game you're not getting every  single last hit with your que it's just  not going to happen because you need to  be able to actually push the wave and  and so on um as you get later on in the  game you do literally get like every  last hit with your que so it does  accelerate um but I I do think you know  even even if you're not getting it by  like 22 minutes at least for the games  that I've played that is pretty slow and  I think 22 minutes is nowhere close to  optimize um I do know that some other  players that I've talked to are saying  in their solo qu games they're able to  get it you know sub 20 basically like  very consistently so it'll be  interesting to see you know how that  does kind of work itself out in  Pro FL wins this game older his first  week will have more wins than L you're  not wrong yeah that's that's crazy you  know that just adds more to you know  late game scaling narrative for na  Marksman in general but fly Quest seem  to be preparing for this next dragon as  Shopify Rebellion are the first ones in  the river zazil marking making sure that  he's scoping out Vision here and  clearing out these wards that fly Quest  are trying to put down to give them that  safe entrance into this objective Point  looks like BVO is able to clear out the  wave first he's going to get the chance  to reset before Dragon spawns in the  next 40 seconds so he might be I don't  know if he has enough gold for a First  full item he does Kraken Slayer online  so BVO is going to be decently strong  for this next fight yep he's going to be  looking pretty strong up in the Top Lane  you can see bipo just went straight  towards that Thor mail Rush here you  know didn't stop for tabies I don't  really love the full Thor mail  completion you know as a first item I  just think in general heal cut early on  especially against atro if you're not  going to kill threat anyway is super  overrated uh I'm really just kind of a  fan in general of these builds where you  just go bomy and then you go into frozen  heart oranic depending on if you're  laning against physical damage or Mr and  then you just build the other like just  think that build is so strong uh be  interested to talk to bipo cuz he is  someone you know who really is very  opinionate about the builds and does  think kind of deeply about them you know  maybe the logic here is that he can just  kind of force trades and take a lot more  scraps that are going to be in his favor  oh shock wave right on the Jensen the  cyclone and the knockups from zazil  there is no room to breathe on that one  Shopify making a clean execution on  Jensen yeah Buu able to flash out but  Jensen not reacting in time or  potentially not thinking he needed to  flash um but he is going to be burst  down in a hurry so this Dragon should be  shif vised no problem off the pick there  Jensen going to be able to TP when he's  up but the dragon should be gone before  then yeah I think the only thing that Bo  is playing for is maybe an isolated pick  here in Spire weight teleport is being  committed by both top laners oh this is  going to be tricky boio is getting  chunked out looks for the silence but he  gets bursted out by BVO whip on the  other side on the wrong side of the  fight as well inspired getting marked  out by fot here's the teleport from  Jensen but Boogie secures it and he gets  out over the wall fly Quest they don't  really have an angle to force another  the fight unless BPO can find a knock up  with this Q looking for the third Q  right on to B boy but there is the  feather storm as he's able to get out  yeah going to be able to get out Jens  though looking for the angle the scoop  finds fake off but the angle is not good  enough for him to really find a kill on  there fly just really devastatingly not  getting anything out of this fight yeah  they don't get much whatsoever they try  to kind of force their way in anyway you  know clearly did not want to give up  that Dragon wanted to maintain their  dragon stacking here got the first one  trying to look for scraps again you know  when you have smolder you want to be  taking these fights getting those  additional Stacks from it but because  Jensen was picked off prior they did not  have a good setup whatsoever and  unfortunately for them not going to walk  away with anything you they didn't push  out the side Lanes they didn't really  get anything from  that I have to wonder if fly Quest are  oh no Jensen he has flash available he  should be fine flash away from the Q but  Boogie oh no Jensen getting taken out  Shopify Rebellion have really put a  focus on Jensen in this game and he is  he's had an incredible split so far this  is a game where he's really been the  focus though yeah he absolutely has and  you know we can take a look at how  Jensen is doing this split versus last  cuz he's actually been really good for F  this split on the left that is Jensen  this split on fly Quest on the right  that is Jensen last split on dignitas so  it really has been stepping up his game  and as a result clearly shop fight  coming in wanting to put the focus on  him wanting to try to knock him down a  Peg and they they have gotten Insanity  into this good spot he is definitely in  that advantageous position Boogie is  getting a lot of kills as well and  Wukong though is not as strong I think  you know when we were seeing it a lot  last year uh it's definitely a pretty  strong pick and it is someone that does  really well with gold you can snowball  heavily you can threaten that backline  especially when you have other people  that can dive with you like the raon  like the hrock like the assistance of a  speed up and a shock wave coming through  from the Oriana so you know boogie in a  great spot here to potentially carry  this game there are quite a few squishy  people on that other side you you're  looking at smolder you're looking at air  if smolder Miss positions at all with  this build you just get one  shot and Mogi is going to be still  dealing a ton of damage even though the  Divine Sunder made him so durable and  tanky with all the pseudo sustain you  were getting with those empowered Q  Stacks The Stride breaker recently  getting buffed on this patch is going to  ensure that once Boogie finds someone  he's going to stay on top of them with  that uh slow active that you get as well  the fact that five Rebellion are really  accelerated in this game against a  composition that is taking time to  really scale on up means that they have  the advantage to try and close this one  out before fly Quest gets to that point  yeah both the passive cleave got buffed  as well as the active on that little  shock wave there as masu just going to  be clearing out that wave uhoh but Mom  is not enough to bail out masu under the  tower and SP is going to be falling next  they got picking up an easy double and  they've got another charge here comes  the heral as it crashes once again  Shopify Rebellion 7 and Z at 18 minutes  against the number one team in the LCS  man they are looking so good in this  game they are crushing them and they've  already picked up wins against Cloud9  and energy they're picking up wins  against all these expected top teams  then they'll go and they'll drop games  against some the teams that you're  thinking oh they should be able to beat  these guys so it is so interesting uh  they have kind of become the new era CLG  the the counter logic gaming here um but  what a great queue there from fake got  interrupting the dash there from masu  when you get queued out of the flap flap  flap that is gone the followup was there  from zazil as he flashed forward and  they burst down  masu really making his job difficult you  he wanted to clear it out with the w  with the Alti got everything except the  cannon but the r is there too so they  just forc the Dive Right In on after it  and it looks like it's probably going to  be uh just a rapid fire second here for  himo just tangoing with fake on but  Boogie might be ready to Boogie himself  as pipo still has some reinforcements in  stage right as boo is going to escort  him out of danger there but Shopify  Rebellion I just want to Circle back to  the fact that they are doing so well cuz  all their wins have been against the top  teams in the LCS but I think that just  reiterates how you maybe you can say  whether it doesn't indicate the strength  and competitiveness of our region  overall but it's been super entertaining  that the fact that there's no free wins  that you can get with any single team  last year I think I bed two teams you  always be like ah well all right the  10th Place team is going to be taken out  here but every single team you cannot  just be at all complaining with them cuz  they will definitely steamroll ahead of  you absolutely I mean we saw the teams  coming in this week that were tied at  the bottom you know dig shopy dig  already got a win shopi looking like  they're in a great position to get a win  here as well uh these teams are very  competitive they have strong players  inspired is he going to go for it I  think he's too far gone yeah fake God  already burning the flash but inspir is  going to chase him past the tower and he  has boio here is it enough damage though  as he pops the world Ender and that  might just be enough to dissuade the  fight from happening and meanwhile  Boogie is on the other side of the map  taking a free dragon because fly quests  are dedicating so many resources just to  take out fake God yeah they're sitting  free top here they're going to be able  get a little chip damage now they're  going to TP it's five top for fly Quest  they need to make this work they they  are all in on this play a Teleport is  coming in from Shopify will it come in  time though Here Comes Mom thank God a  lot of damage but B Boy comes from the  right as he looks to be able to equalize  the fight Fon has already fallen but  quio might be the next one as boy cannot  Step Up in range and sity he gets  speared by Jensen on the back half  that's a double to fly Quest and a  little bit of light yeah that is big  getting a couple kills they needed to  make this play work here chai try to  come in and save him B boy in some  trouble potentially boo looking for the  hook but he Dodges out with his own  flash sa is ging bounce house in the  middle of all the boy finds one back on  a Jensen now to cut this one out against  pppo but he doesn't have the ultimate  anymore mosu is able to K the finishing  blow alongside pipo Here Comes Boogie  Cyclone finds the baby dragon has now  bipples left to scraps but he's got  three more members oh boio he falls does  boy Boogie does Havey enough damage here  here comes the the fight has lasted so  long Boogie just danced all over them  Boogie goes huge for Shopify fly Quest  felt like they were getting back into  this game but it's Boogie  crosses the map after taking the dragon  and crushes them on the play Fly Quest  they know they are behind they know they  need to make him play they already  forced out fake God all the mom comes  through the initial burst very good look  at that multi man W as well from wio  setting up the squad then the stasis  here from Insanity but as he steps  forward Jensen finds an angle to knock  him down we've got to look back at live  though as they are on the bear and this  play went on for a long time as the  Flash Forward from Jensen reacted to  there by B the mechanics on these  players are on point Boo in the area  gets Vision inspired is running from  base but will it be too late are they  going to try to flip this to Jensen  unless he can get a miracle steal but  the Smite is Good from Boogie Shopify  Rebellion 22 minutes in the game 12 and  four 6K gold up Baron at their side if  you told me this would be the result  coming into this game I would still be  surprised but man I have been loving the  LCS so far this season man this is just  such an exciting second game to follow  up what the Banger we already had in  Team Liquid in 100 thieves and it looks  like it just keeps on delivering in week  four yeah absolutely we've been getting  really cool picks the teams have been  very competitive has been a lot of fun  you for fly Quest at this point you want  to say well maybe smolder can bail us  out but not even 160 saacks here 22  minutes in so masu struggling to keep up  those Stacks you to still be involved in  the plays to maximize the stacking has  not really been able uh to do it yes you  do still the AER you have this molder so  if the game can go really long there is  opportunities but again with this build  there's so little room for error you are  so squishy with this build compared to  the more tanky versions and there is a  really powerful dive there's a five kill  Wukong who now has a sun sky plus that  stride breaker Insanity you know forming  pretty well you he's in a pretty strong  spot behind him on those two items so  it's going to be tough for masu to stay  alive even if he can get to the stacks  that he so desperately needs will he be  able to live in a fight I don't really  know and it's just not even two items  yet at this point compared to B boy  who's already working on a third so  severely behind and I think fly Quest  took a huge gamble by having such a  heavy scaling composition all eyes were  on inspired to really be that bridge but  ever since that bot lane outplay from  viy and zazil who I mean Bo has been  performing insanely well this game as  well but in every single win from  Shopify Rebellion so far it has always  been some type of fumbled attempt to  shut down BVO and zazil from the  beginning when you look at the energy  game they tried to go for the dive they  got blasted when C9 tried to go for the  dive they got blasted and when fly Quest  tried to upset them once again they feel  the same  fate it's tough man you you make  mistakes this team will punish you this  time you know wasn't about a dive or  anything like that I really think it's  just been about solid play here from  Shopify Boogie right place right time  everywhere he needed to be throughout  this game putting on pressure keeping  his farm up and he has really just been  such a Difference Maker here masu now  does have that rapid fire completed you  can see St through now for inspired as  well um but the item completion is still  not really inspiring a lot of confidence  that they can get it done here as  everyone on the other side is kind of  equal or ahead except for mid lane where  Jensen with that death cap now you start  to say hey maybe you get that right  fight for the azir and it could happen  yeah um but we'll see you know they do  have some xfactor style Champions they  have good engage they have good pick  with potential hooks from Blitz but  Blitz from behind is just such a bad  Champion it is really difficult to find  those angles for hooks as the YT just  getting throwing out time and time again  here for wave CLE they're just trying to  buy time they're trying to get these  Stacks it's 192 now for mosu so he is  closing in on that Benchmark that he  need there's pings there's PS for  teleport this is a long con fling from  wio but who do they want to look for  zazil is going to pop the quickness  finds the Target on inspired as well  they pull Insanity can they burst him  out he goes golden with the stasis does  it that enough time shock wave on to two  masu and Jensen are almost gone Jensen  survives but masu Falls as now the rest  of flight are all depending on Jensen to  save this game from ending right here  yeah Jensen in trouble he's got to run  they look for another one Jensen still  has no HP to work with almost going down  to than God he falls a straight feather  from B boy clips him as Shopify  Rebellion will find four and it's just  bio left oh that hook from boo might  have actually ended the game he hooked  him in and unfortunately it means yes  they get a kill but Jensen goes down as  well that extra little bit of damage was  all they need m is going to be back up  in five but he's got no sums he instant  ghost flash when he saw zil Ting towards  him then had no sums and no e to react  to the shock wave from Insanity that  caught him he instantaneously dies as  fake God comes over the top with the Q  looks like they won't feel confident to  try to push for the end here they're  going to continue playing towards these  objectives with the base in tatters the  inhib down in both bot and top this will  mean a lot of farming is going to be of  given over to them masu looking like  he's going towards Zia's third uh as the  itemization I'm guessing there you know  with the cloth Armor Plus the I mean  maybe just to sit on a Seeker so that he  doesn't get insta blasted but I I mean  at that point I don't I don't know it's  it's it's a it's tough right because  like I I'm saying this is the weakness  of the build which is why I think you  know it is it would have made a  difference in this game probably not so  let's just put that out there um but you  know I do think you know you are so  squishy it's so difficult to actually be  in range in Auto attacking that is why I  just straight up don't like [ __ ] build  um and we saw like he he's recognizing  you know what I can't really step up I'm  just going to get one shot and he  instantly had to use both his thumbs  then he just gets insta kill by the  shock wave plus that Q from fake God so  I think it is going to be Seekers or or  full zonas you know working towards that  just trying to stay alive hoping that  they overcommit maybe you can use stasis  to immune a shock wave and turn around  and fight in that way but yeah uh  obviously it's it's tough cuz when you  look at the compositions now on both  sides I mean like yeah fly Quest have  this insane scaling composition and you  have really one major form of disengage  that's the emperor divide once that's  gone there's nothing really strong from  the side of fly Quest that stops booy  from brw forcing into your team zazil  just blitzing right through fake God  just charging forward as well fly quests  are just so dependent and so limited on  how many ways to disengage in this fight  it feels near impossible yeah it it is  really tough right you know range is  kind of that weakness he finally has 225  Stacks so uh just you know before 28  minutes it did hit that Mark the  question is going to be can he actually  effectively use those Stacks now can you  get spam Q's out without just getting  one shot right cuz who are you supposed  to step up and Q in this if you step  forward to try to qu the atrox and he  eqs you you're probably dead if you get  caught by the Wukong you're probably  dead shock wave dead so it it is going  to be really really tough he kind of has  to really make sure that he's maximizing  his damage while still waiting out those  initial engage tools you know you have  to stay close enough that they can fail  the engage then you can punish that's  the only way they can win and they want  to get this TP from Jens and they're  trying to force it he's still staying B  he's refusing to come in just yet oh  Boogie tries to flank on inspired I  don't think he has flash available he  gets taken out very early on masu is the  next Target he has The Seekers this time  for the stasis but will even fall he had  the 225 Stacks but just not enough  damage as Jensen is trying to do work on  the front line while bipo stalling but  it's just not enough Shopify Rebellion  are taking everything away from fly  Quest they don't even need the baron  they have two in open Inhibitors are  going to just Pro forcer Wings in the  game B Bo flashing in Jensen tries to  punish but the rest of Shai Rebellion  rally around B voy their newest player  as Jensen just gets completely  obliterated by BVO shot by Rebellion are  going to do it taking down flag Quest  who are in sole possession of first  place they Crush through the Empire of  these top teams stand no match for the  rebellion of Shopify as they take down  again another first place  team fun game to watch here nicely done  on on the engage they start the baron  they look for the turn it is again  Boogie finds the ulti pops the Cyclone  flashes in on top of smolder and as mosu  tries to use the fly to get over the  wall to Flash Forward there from zazil  follows up on it ceing him out of that  ability locks him down bursts him down  no way for him to get out of there they  were really on point with the hard  engage here Chi you know people have  been kind of some people on one side are  really loving that they're cooking and  doing all these crazy drafts but there  has become a more vocal group there say  well you guys actually just can't play  normal you can't play a standard draft  you're not going to be able to actually  make it work they kind of just proving  the haters here a little bit coming out  with probably their most impressive most  solid win of the Season yes they had  already beaten some really top teams but  it was more from punishing their  opponent's mistakes on these failed  Dives this one was just them being  proactive them finding engages them  coming with a really strong draft that  worked from multiple angles combined  well you know shutting down what mosu  was bringing out here with the smolder  you know clearly they were prepared for  it they knew how to answer it and I just  think it's a really solid game plan  executed very very well from shocky yeah  I mean even just straight up mechanical  outplays as well you could tell that fly  quests were aware of  how how threatening B boy and zel could  be if they were ahead which is why they  threw the focus down there early on in  the game but just simple Mo Maneuvers  being able to dodge out on CC abilities  and then zazil flashing forward to block  inspired's cube when he was looking for  the cleanup and then even Boogie himself  I think he was also just a clear stand  out for me in this game saving what  could have been fly Quest comeback back  in yep the Jersey looking really nice  too dude yeah themed for Lunar New Year  today that's freaking awesome the red  and gold such a clean color clean on the  rift clean on the drip as  well as I believe we are ready we will  be joining wild turtle and fake God on  stage for the interview  [Music]  hello hi fake God hello how do you feel  after that win I feel great uh it's a

like comment and  subscribe  thanks for that Emily unfortunately fly  Quest lost again today and dig won so  that was a foretelling of what was going  to happen let's check out the players of  the game from today first comment cannot  be about the rolls what stands  out I I need to wow quids really  improved from last year fudge had a nice  bounceback for Cloud9 Boogie with the  great Wukong for me I am now a quidd  enjoyer okay quidd has had a great split  so far and it felt like after the last  split everyone's been holding their  tongue and then on top of that  everyone's kind of been attributing a  lot of success mostly to like working  alongside River but I think he's just  been standing out and I it's been great  to see a lot of progression that he's  had and the fact that 100 th had double  down on him and I want to call out  Boogie because we did talk about how  Wukong receed but Buffs on this P we  talked more that they were more targeted  towards Lan Wukong uh but he came out  with a really good game and also  something I noticed is that he was going  into his Lanes a lot more which is  really when I think he Excel a lot as a  jungler I'm going to steal I'm just  going to go for a second one Tomo  smoulder he for picking smolder  immediately he has been slamming that in  solo queue since smolder was released  and it worked out I was a little afraid  when he got cheesed by oay and he died  with both sums being blown but then he  ended up coming out strong in team  fights and overall like the tips and  tricks that he talked about in the  interview as well like he got to be able  to showcase the strength of smolder and  now we're starting to see it get picked  a little bit more so that's nice to see  stack him fast let's get into the  highlights for today  to see all those winners Cloud9 ended  their four game losing streak a rematch  of the summer finals from last split  they've actually beaten energy twice now  after this yeah I think in this game  more than the first time they met a lot  of it came off of some NRG kind of Happy  game moments let's just say like uh  there were and we'll we'll see how  energy uh regroup because after this  obviously they're now on a little bit of  a loss  streak but I think it feels really good  for C9 specifically especially since I  feel like maybe people won't have as  much to say about their draft this time  around it was a a lot more like ease of  execution uh was there and the team  looked pretty well coordinated they  outscaled for sure a Mortals versus  digas was looking pretty good for  immortals early for me castle with  another atro game way kind of dumping  damage but dignitas had a really cool  draft that was the thing uh at first I I  could just s him in I also felt like  okay they completely destroyed smolder  after like that second base it seemed  like it was going to be a pretty easy  game for me it was some of the fights  that IMT were St and Miss execute the  dragon fights for me for were a big one  actually this one was just a huge if I  remember correctly this is a this was a  way moment in a half man he blew them up  there were a few Dragon fights  there were a few Dragon fights but this  one was crazy and Sol for me solidified  IMT winning but that didn't happen yeah  I think the big thing for me is IMT  should not be fighting without Quay and  then dig were obviously just waiting for  smolder to come online and there was a  fight in the top side where it ended up  shifting in Dig's favor and that's kind  of when smolder started taking over yeah  third game of the day almost had a t  diff Team Liquid did pick up Soul during  this one but but 100 thieves so many  just massive Tia team fight wins that  led to quid's player of the game it was  actually pretty crazy this double flick  was insane so like that one I  immediately I thought Team Liquid was  going to win that fight before that play  ended up happening I think this was a  forc fight where the tar ulties were  just not hitting um so overall the team  fights team liqu found their lead they  were starting to solidify and I think  just too many fights that were just  getting  bodged yeah I mean this this is really  cool to see from 100 thieves though like  we've been talking a lot about their  success and a lot of it is due to the  way that they draft around the players  they have and the way they understand  the players they have probably the most  lopsided game of the day surprisingly  Shopify greater than fly Quest okay I  hated the blitz pick by the way I I'm so  mad that blz yes absolutely if you're  going to do nothing and lose you may as  well do it on Pike like I just don't  understand what the blitz C was supposed  to be doing maybe there's a future where  this ends up being meta and I can eat my  words but right now I'm going to say I  just hated it this was a really close  fight just specifically because this one  looked like um black West was turning it  mhm the Wukong who was doing Dragon then  went farmed mid then went topside to  actually help out in the play because he  realized it was going long enough and  then gets a triple kill so like Boogie  had an ideal gameplay after that one  what a split so far it's been a fun time  yeah it's been a really fun time I'm  actually I think I know the standings  like I think I could recite them yeah  but it's going to be close because the  worst  team three wins the worst team has three  wins like one game away from 500 to be  last which means Cloud9 is a game out of  last despite winning today you're going  to do this every day you're going to do  this yeah is in  last I was like here it comes but  they're a game out of 30 no seriously  it's uh it's just compressing so much  it's crazy I also want to shout out 100  thieves again they are are solidly in  second place like sole possession of  second place going into tomorrow uh  before we have a little break after that  and like even even if they lose tomorrow  right which they are facing kind of a  revamped rejuvenated C9 that makes this  match super interesting because I don't  think any of us or not I don't think I  know none of us expected this 100  Thieves Team to be looking as good as  they have and also be this high in the  standings dnit tosing uh NRG Team Liquid  Honda honestly shopify's hardest matchup  they're not going up against the first  place team so let's see how this one  goes yeah they're wingless against  second to eth oh my God they got to  change it sometimes it's tough it's  tough and Immortals versus fly Quest no  this was probably the easiest week on  paper for fly Quest they're like we're  six in one we're flying high we play you  know last place Shopify Immortals easy  20 let's go next nope that's not how it  works we have an interesting bunch of  teams I think it's going to be fun to  see how tomorrow goes but looks like  we're looking at the schedule watch this  right watch that right after this it's  on twitch.tv/ LCS Challengers Wild Card  versus fly Quest Challenger that  actually should be a banger and fearless  draft so you get to see lots of unique  Champions if you don't know what  Fearless draft is go over check it out  it's really cool that's it for us though  we'll be back tomorrow at 4 P p.m.  Eastern 1 p.m. Pacific so let's send it  over to apa stream he's streaming see  you over  there what play Elli and soul play  smaller High's driving he's got his  license oh my  God who he's going to be caught by the  bar but he's the only Target now

this feels weird what I'm not  used to  thisp going to be healed and shielded by  aro's Iver but now rich wants to drive  in it's all right in the middle of  everybody but Tomo's ready to counter  attack Castle wants the smolder but he  ain't going to find him Tomo's already  killed off to and now Immortals where  can you even go a triple kill back to  smolder dignitas are ready to March it  down mid for the NEX  nice go I actually didn't even do  anything nice this is  stos yeah if we even fighting this clear  this WOW sniper  sniper good  myice it's okay we're really not behind  at all

      "Translated Transcript:\n",
      "[{'text': \"I was like wow that's pretty strong  especially with some of the strong you  know ideas about the game that that you  have on your team with Jensen and bppo  but it it really seems to be working out  for them they even have Good Vibes like  whippo is hyping up his young bottom  Lane you know after every couple kills  and he's going over there hugging them  and uh it really does seem like this fly  Quest  team deserves to be at the top and and  should should be projected to stay at  the top yeah I think one of the think  that to me was the big difference  between where they are and where I  expected them to be was I think that uh  masu and busio have been a lot better A  lot faster than I expected like I  thought that they could get there but I  wasn't really sure how good they would  be early on right and the reality is the  game is like largely played around about  bot Lane and if your Bot Lane's just a  black hole where everything goes to die  then uh you know you're not going to win  that many games but no they've actually  been really really solid um we saw them  absolutely clap a and Bot L which I  guess I guess a lot of people are kind  of doing these days we can get to that  later um but no they they just seem to  be kind of working really well together  um they're playing pretty confidently  they're like even in the games where  things are going wrong they still seem  to be able to play like pretty  aggressively and still kind of stay on  the right foot with that so it's been  really fun to watch because these are  two guys who you know are coming up from  naacl like relatively recently they both  won most valuable prospects so it's cool  to see that like some of this like na  Talent is actually doing well and I know  um I will dominate tweeted out really  just recently that he thought part of  the reason that this what was so  entertaining was not only the parody but  he thinks that mechanically um this is  like maybe the best LCS has been in a  long time you know and partially I think  that is because we have a lot of these  like new players coming up yeah I can  totally see that I think that  um I was going to say kind of contrary  to that that I think Flack Quest botlan  while they're they are doing you know  pretty solid they have shown some  weakness you know even in some of the  games they won they've had kind of rough  laning phases and I mean if you guys  remember fly quest one loss was probably  like the hardest loss any team has had  all split that was one where you know  botling energy yeah bot Lan just went  horribly in the beginning and then they  started like siphoning all resources to  try to stabilize and they just couldn't  get there so um I guess that's what I  was worried would happen in a lot more  games yeah I mean definitely not trying  to take anything away from them they've  done well I think that um it it's tough  you know coming into the league and I  wonder if other teams will start putting  more focused down there trying to  pressure them some and if they'll be  able to handle it yeah especially  everyone's thinking of the fly Quest  versus Cloud9 like kind of hype match up  where they're double killing  Berserker um and Vulcan multiple times  by themselves and like that started a  really hype super week I feel like fly  Quest being the only team to get a 30-0  super weak just feels like they have so  much momentum and that carried on too I  was like that was two really good Varys  games  uh for masu and then what was his other  champ that he played in the third game  uh is something else but it was pretty  it was pretty good well I think it was  aelio right he he was he was SC and that  was that that was decent too I just feel  like busio you know winning multiple  player of the games as well Nautilus  hooks on points just yeah definitely  definitely a lot better I feel like then  expected the timeline that was that was  set out oh that that Nautilus hook on uh  the yeah that lollipop that was so nasty  like dude people are flaming out line  say oh this just shows how n say it's so  easy to H hooks you still have to know  exactly where to throw it to not just to  have it hit the tower right like you you  go and do it then if it's so op like  like Nautilus can be annoying to play  against but I I like him I like when  naus is meta I think he makes things  happen like he's he'll he'll get a lot  of kills or he'll get a ton of deaths  like you know or both it's never going  to be a boring game when in it I I agree  and I mean it's like the hook the hook  cheats for sure but you like he was  abusing it to the maximum and that's  what a pro player should do right you  should be able to find those angles it's  like when I watch a really good bar  players like I play quite a bit of B and  the b q cheats a lot but some people go  for Q's that I would never even attempt  and it like hits them then turns  sideways in Hooks and I'm like how did  you even know that that was going to  work like that that angle looks like  that should never work they 100% cheat  it cheats like crazy but but knowing  exactly how far you can take it I think  really is a lot of it right um you know  especially on Champions that are not  super mechanically difficult it's all  about you know game knowledge and  understanding okay exactly like how far  can I go you know what's the difference  between the best nist player and the  worst na player exactly when you can  engage you know how to play out the  fights how you can abuse these things to  the maximum and that's always something  that I I've kind of found impressive um  about even some of the basic Champs it's  the same thing like Trin beir people  talk about you know as like this  Champion doesn't do anything you just  spin in and right click them but one  thing I've always found impressive about  like really really good trir players is  just their understanding of exactly when  they can dive people and exactly when  they can pull off these exactly when  they can crit yeah EXA true true true  same thing with Yumi like you need to  know exactly when you can just AFK on  your ad car the whole game when get a  snack you those Trend players watch  netfli know your bathroom timings you  popcorn  breaks um but bbo inspired and Jensen  also I think doing you know really good  job um J had a monster trist game this  week against uh dig after kind of the  trash talk back and forth about uh the  current crop of of Korean imports being  overrated uh he went up against do and X  was on that Pros with him so he was like  well we'll see how you do against do you  know blah blah blah and Jensen brought  out the Tristana played really well um  bipo has been playing a lot of different  stuff um inspired's been playing a lot  of different stuff even brought out the  brand and brand I think it was the only  brand game we had in the LCS which was  really surprising me because brand had  been turbo op in in Jungle it felt like  pretty much this entire season I think  Boogie also played him once oh did he  okay yeah um but I do agree he's real  strong in Soul C right now he's one of  the Champions getting hit next patch  it's hard for me to know exactly how  much those Nerfs are going to do but  Nerfs nonetheless especially because one  of the Nerfs is fixing a bug where his  passive was doing more than you know it  should that's really hard to quantify  how how much that is going to Nerf him  but it should it should be a decent tap  down I think that game specifically like  that was the masuo continual double  kills on Berserker Vulcan bottom and so  Inspire just got to free farm so it was  like kind of dream brand you just  farming away and your bottom Lane is  winning your Top Lane is a Cante so he's  fine up there it doesn't really matter  and then they were you know able to to  win the game despite JoJo having some  pretty good you know Nico engages that  gave Cloud9 just enough hope to be even  more sad at the end but I think this fly  Quest team I I 100% agree like they they  also are really flexible in the  Champions that they can use I think  that's a really good point to hit on  especially with how outspoken bppo is it  almost seems like he's like defensive of  his unique picks where when sniper  picked the Olaf he was tweeting out he  was like ah man that Olaf he missed the  double kill angle there these these  other players thinking that they know  what they could do with Olaf n it's it  felt like it's really he it's part of  his identity you know and he since  they're having so much success with it  like all the members get to you know  talk their trash see say whatever they  want have that confidence all right well  we have three teams tied in second right  now two of them are not really  surprising that they're like in second  uh energy you know Team Liquid two teams  I think were kind of predicted to be up  near top um but energy obviously coming  off a onew super week not going to be  that happy about it but TL and 100  thieves both went 2-1 in the super week  and for 100 thieves to be tied for  second is kind of shocking I know quite  a few people had them actually in eighth  even that I was seeing in some of the  community stuff I think I had them maybe  sixth or something like that I can't  remember if I had them fifth or sixth I  had them one Higher at fifth okay I  can't remember or if you had them at  fifth then I had them at Fourth like I  was only one higher than you guys which  was like I think I put Shopify above  them so I think I had them I had Shopify  then 100 thieves 5 six yeah but still  for them to be in second I think is  pretty crazy um and even talking to  Golden glue before the season and the  team you on their expectations I think  they're really surprised I think it was  golden even tweeted out like wait were  tied for a second you know like uh cuz  there's a lot of a lot of young players  a lot of new players on this team and I  think the expectation was definitely  that it was going to take a lot more  time for them to get up to speed and  even when they did I don't think they  really considered that they could be  competing you know this high up I think  a lot of people also expected quid to be  bad quid got a lot of flak last year and  when he was announced even on the  returning roster it was heavily  criticized I thought he he's been  actually great considering how much  criticism was thrown at him yeah there  definitely still are mistakes but like  the ability to pull out that atrox and  absolutely stomp Shopify this is  something I said on waiting room but  Shopify continually going with yeah  these unique picks of having multiple  tanks on their team I don't know if it's  Unique when it's three Scions it's not  unique anymore no that the Z gar Z Garen  okay the Garen was you you got a little  po there anyways my point my my point  was since they even if you're doing  something that's not meta if you  continually do that same thing then  you're you're just always playing your  own meta and people can counter that and  really big props to Golden glue as well  as quidd as well as uh Sam Spooks the  assistant coach for 100 thieves they did  exactly what I was hoping for they  crafted a team that will [ __ ] on tanks  and they did just that with their with  their double solo counter pick and they  absolutely like steamroll it because  even if you're doing your wacky stuff  that's off meta if you keep doing it  then someone's going to pull up the  counter and that's exactly what we want  you know that  flexibility and and that reactivity and  it does shine through but only if you  have players that are one willing and  two capable to be also flexible like  that one thing that's interesting about  hun thieves is of their five players um  only sniper and meech have played the  same champ more than once uh jungle mid  and support have all played a unique  champ in every single game which you  know it does show um you know diversity  and what they want to play it might mean  they don't necessarily know what's best  or they just have a really wide array  that they're comfortable with not really  sure yet it'll take some more time one  thing that I do Wonder watch though I  will say I've loved the varet oh yeah I  who doesn't I think that I I always have  this question in the back of my head  it's like like how much of the standings  right now are just who which the the  best team seem to be the ones that like  understand Lucian sucks and I know we  talked about this in another episode but  like it's it's every week every week  people pick him it's not even it's just  like man this is a really good Lucian  game I'm going to pick him it's just  like first pick me Lucian it feels it  feels kind of stubborn too I mean we  we'll talk more about Cloud9 but like it  it's it's almost to the point where it's  just losing every time and then they  lose they get flamed for it and they're  like you know what you're wrong I'm  going to I'm lose again it's not CU  Lucian guys like you guys messed up that  mid 2v2 our top Point had no pryo like  dude I was winning my lane from levels  three to four like from levels three to  four actually Elan won one game uh it's  not every game that he's lost thank you  was on the winning team actually he was  on the winning team he was like zero2  and one when the the game was almost  over like I don't know man a dub is a  dub yeah no it it is true and I'm so  curious to see if people are going to  kind of stick with it if they're going  to feel you know be stubborn and just  like no this is correct we're doing the  right pick we just have to nail down our  play or if they're going to move away I  think these new Zer and smolder are  going to force them to stop picking this  bait champion because I don't know like  it's it's almost hilarious seeing teams  just keep picking it and it's just  completely horrible every time it's  really funny too because Yan uh was on  hotline league with his coach spawn and  he had a message directly for the people  criticizing Lucian picks in Pro play and  I can't even repeat what he said be uh  because it was explicit and so beep  beze it and I'll keep just pointing to  the Willian win rate like go ahead and  pick him man if you think he's good play  him but I mean opponents will thank you  we can't even put the clip in the  comments or anything probably because  it's expl I was just say go check it out  it's uh it's pretty funny um quit quid  also I was just going touching on him he  actually had like stats obviously on  everything but um he's third in CSD he's  also third and highest DPM he's like you  know like he's actually like his Lane is  going pretty well he's contributing in  team fights he's actually having a  pretty good a pretty good season I  wouldn't say he's the best best  millionaire or anything like that um but  definitely I think it's it feels like a  far cry from uh last last year where he  was just getting roasted every week so I  do think he kind of deserves his flower  so to speak like he should get a little  bit of credit um because it feels like  everyone was telling me last year no no  no no no what you're seeing on stage is  not the real quid like he he he's better  just trust me but I feel like a lot of  times when you hear that stuff it never  actually pans out the person just keeps  playing like that on stage but he  actually has he has improved and he's  he's showing a lot better games on stage  I think absolutely hun thieves is for  sure one of the teams that has impressed  me most because coming into this split  you know I think all of us had them in  the bottom half the standings and when  you look at how they built their team it  almost felt like they weren't trying  right like of their roster last or  they're out of money they were  definitely  trying I'm just saying how it looks I'm  not saying how it is but I mean of their  roster last year quid received the most  criticism he's the only one they kept  they they put in uh like a bunch of  rookies or then they left out when River  golden Guardians exploded and they got  to get River yeah but I mean all all  that considered I think it it it's a  testament to you know doing something  right they're playing well it also for  me just makes me have even more respect  for River cuz he's a really good player  um and the fact that he just continually  finds success on any team he's he's on  other junglers have a lot of respect for  him uh I was asking Spa you know who's  the hardest jungler you've played  against he said River and so um he's a  demon in Solo que so that even further  emphasizes your point of any team that  he is on he he was at a 80% win rate in  in the top of Challenger I know spa and  a lot of people were talking about how  it like that's nuts it yeah I mean it's  it's just it's cool seeing them do well  especially with uh me and sniper coming  in both very green and pro play and  still managing to do pretty well yep uh  energy obviously bad super week it's  kind of interesting because last week we  were talking about oh yeah we really  thought energy was going to have this  slow start you know but hey it didn't  happen at all they didn't really run  into these issues because they were um  sitting at I guess three and one um  coming into Super week and and looking  pretty good and it seemed like they had  kind of escaped a lot of the issues that  people had been hearing that they had  been having that there' be you know some  difficulties incorporating um whoi and  now that's even been talked about you  know in some some interviews about oh  yeah we're kind of like arguing a lot on  the team and these types of things so  where do you guys stand on on energy now  you know like they're cing falling back  a little bit to where they were in  summmer Split where there's this  inconsistency where they can look really  good one day against a good team then  look really bad the next next day  against a bad team like have they  regressed is this just a blip on the  radar where do you guys stand I I still  think energy is pretty good uh when I  watch their games I'm not sitting there  being like wow this is a team that is  completely clueless they do not know  what they're doing um I think they're  solid you know they haven't won every  single game I think it is going to be  tough when you have you know a vocal  leader like who Who coming into an  established team there's going to be  some uh friction just getting everyone  on the same page it's natural totally  normal um and so yeah I wouldn't be too  worried if I was them I think they're  you know doing just fine yeah there I  feel there's two different issues one  could be this you know I don't think  arguing is inherently a problem as long  as they're no as it's productive exactly  and as long as they're able to work work  it out and I've heard from multiple  members on the team that they actually  like having a confrontational style and  bringing things up and then talking  through it sometimes I've also heard  like they spend way too much time on it  and so that can be a time sync which is  definitely an issue when you only have  one week and you know we're constantly  going to live patch and you really have  to be good with time management and what  you're going to practice uh and yeah  that can be a drag but I think some of  the things that might be a little  worrying are that there are some of  these like in-game mistakes that you're  going whoa like this does feel like  years past energy or even like CLG days  when we would be criticizing them for  like why are you over chasing here why  are you you know overextending diving  too far in what seems like and uh an  obvious like 20% chance of success type  of play was the Shopify game where they  had that horrible bot Lane dive yeah  that that was one of them um there have  been a couple of those a couple of  remember both of Shai's wins by the way  are off of the other team diving and  turbo inting and then getting slammed  they're just good at playing Dives yeah  they're smile the goats yeah there's  there's a reason we will get to them at  the bottom of the standings uh but  honestly I think that energy are going  to be fine and pull it back but these  These are the types of mistakes that  were kind of like I feel like used to  seeing from from that Squad and so it's  not completely surprising to me to see a  couple of them mhm as long as they reain  it in yeah I mean looking through their  games just both their losses were too  vars Veris a champion that's like the  reverse Lucian he's kind of just winning  every game I mean when there's a  champion that Holy the reverse Luan I  mean it it's this is how every split a  bow and arrow Lucian has two guns I'm  I'm telling you every single split this  will happen at the beginning of the  Season there's just winners and losers  in life Lucian is a loser ver is a  winner right it happens like people  don't always get the right read from  scrim sometimes they're a little  stubborn to change their mind and uh  yeah you know sometimes people will not  immediately recognize which Champs are  the best and it's hard to right like  there's so many factors going into a  game but uh definitely worth noting it's  definitely a scrim data thing too you  know anytime a champion is garbage on  stage and you talk to people like well  it's winning every game in scrims you  know people people always uh do kind of  fall into that did you did you ever had  any experiences with that when you guys  were playing um you know throughout your  career because it it does feel like such  an obvious trap like when you're on the  outside looking in right like when  you're watching the games as a co-  streamer or a Caster you're just like  just stop picking it dummies like it  clearly doesn't work it's losing every  time but then you talk to the pros and  and they're saying yeah but we played 20  games this week and it won all of them  you know what I mean and it's like how  how do you parse those two things and  make sure that you're you're not  actually just you know saying ah screw  Lucian because we lost once on stage  versus the 20 times you played in scrims  and making sure you're getting the right  info I mean it can be hard and you know  not everyone's going to get the right  read for sure I think you just have to  try to be open-minded and for me I  always try to understand like why  something happened more than just what  happened because something that would  trigger me a little bit is when we would  you know go into our draft meeting and  bring up win rates from scrims because  to me that doesn't matter like you can  lose a game that had absolutely nothing  to do with a certain Champion that was  played or vice versa you know win a game  that had nothing to do with it and then  you also have to look like what was  happening in the games were were you  picking this champ and they were limit  testing random matchups into it and  running it down was this Champion  getting overly fed every single game is  that a normal thing to happen um so just  where are the advantages and  disadvantages coming from like what's  expected to happen and you know that can  be very hard to keep everything in mind  yeah I mean like nobody can do it  perfect it's it's a something you just  always have to keep working at and so  yeah I mean there like bait picks come  up all the time yep absolutely um but  yeah I mean I'm kind of on the same page  I think energy can probably pull it back  um TL the other two in one team they had  a pretty good super week went 2 and one  um are you feeling are you guys feeling  like they're beating some of the  allegations as far as only being able to  play like scaling comps and whatnot or  does this kind of still feel that way  because I know that was kind of what I  felt like I'd been seeing I've been  seeing some other people echoing that  where it was just like all the previous  weeks they'd pickeling a little bit more  aggressive on day one lose and then day  two they're like zeri Lulu and air and  then you know like they lose again with  a little bit more aggressive and then  they're going okay we're going Tristana  and felios and three tanks uh I I  wouldn't say they're beating those  allegations because that's what they've  been doing pretty much like tank top  tank jungle APA on a scaling mid and  then like pretty much all range support  Spot Lane which you know it is a way to  play it's valid  it doesn't  necessarily show like work on a ton of  different things as a team right like  you don't necessarily get practice being  proactive like being really aggressive  putting the the pressure on the other  team so it is working for TL I would  like to see them try some other stuff  because I think only playing one way you  know it's not flexible what if the meta  changes what if people come up with  strats that are really good against what  you're doing so um yeah I I would like  to see them try other stuff I mean this  this last week in super week they played  they had the one Lucian uh game they had  one felos game that had one Ezreal game  I think the biggest part of their wins  has actually just been impact on uder in  impact on uder has done so much he has  one mid lane twice for APA by roaming  down there he has won jungle multiple  times by invading jungle killing enemy  jungler not killing enemy jungler but  harassing enemy jungler and then and  stealing camps I prob impact is playing  out of his mind right now uh there have  been a couple points where even um in in  the content that they're releasing  afterwards uh like you know like umpty  goes one way and the the like the rest  of the team was like going trying to go  the other way or something like that I  think that one change we are going to  see though for sure is that APA is GNA  play even more but I don't even know if  this a change because he's already  played a bunch of zigs but zigs is  getting buffed so he's going to keep  playing zigs and guess what that's  really good with scaling because you  have super good wave clear and two  seconds off your SEL charge does make  you safer and as well as the extra  little bit of armor that he's getting so  I think that Team Liquid will probably  play still pretty similarly I like they  are open to  doing obviously Del Luan bottom lanes  and a little bit of aggressive stuff cor  JJ is in my opinion always best when  he's on engaged supports and is like  creating action for them so um I'm I'm  not particularly super worried about  them only being a scaling team I think  they can be a super action pack team but  we have when they we have seen yeah we  have seen some of the mistakes coming in  those mid game you know either going to  the objectives or the team fight  actually at them yeah for for sure um  definitely nothing in their play is  indicated they can't play other styles  but like I said I just want to see it  because there there have been those uh  you know narratives floating around  impact can't play carries uh APA can't  play you know assassins or whatever and  I don't know if it's true probably not  but so far we've seen them pretty much  sticking to what works range support  scaling mid tank top and I think we'll  probably continue to see that yeah I  mean it's it's not a bad way to play  it's one of the like probably the most  common way to play of of all time in  league but you know a little bit of  flexibility is not a bad thing  absolutely well as long as you have at  least enough Champions within that that  if you go into playoffs you can't just  get targeted out right um I impa can  play a ton of Tanks I'm I'm not really  worried about that but every single win  they have is with him playing uder and  uder is actually 10-2 in LCS um I think  it's probably the highest win rate  champion in the LCS with like any number  real number of games um and yeah APA  obviously it is still big concern for  him like what the champion pools is  looking like I think because that was  one of the big criticisms and kind of  questions people had coming into this  split and I don't feel like he's really  changed any Minds because he's just  played the three Champs his year zigs  and Tristana which were three that like  he was already kind of playing and  obviously there was already some  criticism to how he's kind of playing um  the the azir but either way I think  they're they're doing pretty well it  feels like on is fitting into the team  pretty well um I don't feel like there  was any it seems like there any big  downgrade from piosik or anything um  maybe maybe Mt is a little bit less  proactive I guess than piosik it feels  like when piosik had his best games it  was him just kind of like taking over  the game like as as an individual  whereas umt it feels like his good games  are more enabling his  team yeah yeah uh either way they're  sitting at four and three doing pretty  well uh the next teams down in fifth  three and four are Cloud9 and Immortals  which is honestly shocking to say that  they're tied yeah I think we we had them  as first and eighth in their tied right  now I mean I don't know I'm 03 super  week for Cloud9 it had nothing to do  with me being a conator for Cloud9 but  like like they're not a fifth place I'm  sorry like they're not they're not I  would still probably put him first if if  I was betting on who's going to win the  split it would still be C9  because I mean look at their losses  they're trolling in most the games like  they wi they lost when you do it four  times in a row how much can you forgive  it's the Lucian they lost with Lucian  and then they pick Lucian again and  guess what happened they lost again I  don't know aren isn't it more problems  if you just want to criticize draft  can't you criticize more than just  solution they went they went against C  it was so funny we interviewed the  players we interviewed APA and uh and  JoJo before this game and JoJo's like  yeah he's only a zigs one trick you take  him off that you know he's he's bad  basically and then they give them zigs  and pick Lucian and give over I think  even uder as well it was it was like  their opponents are just getting to play  Blind pick like they're just loading in  and picking whatever they want so it's  like that's that's a problem that means  you suck at drafting it it does but at  the same time like I don't know if you  saw uh I think JoJo did an interview  with with Ashley yeah I saw it and he's  saying like you know uh it's more fun  this way than if we just Stomp the Le C  it's kind of cope but at the same time  having so much fun losing four straight  games they did you see the players face  this they were having a lot of fun yeah  I mean they were loving it they were  they were having highing you know dude  like put him in playoffs have like put  him in games that matter and I guarantee  we're GNA not see this at least I hope  to God we don't see this uh because you  know the longer the The Meta goes on the  more people start realizing like you're  not just going to ignore a champ being  10 and two or Varys is like 10 and five  or something you're not just going to  keep picking the champion that's never  winning I think that putting Cloud9 on a  good draft they're probably just going  to win so like I haven't my faith in  them hasn't wavered I think they  definitely made a lot of mistakes in  game two I like you you you can't say  like they also had a horrendous bottom  Lane dive they they also had a bunch of  int moments which you can say they're  trolling cuz you know they're good  players right individually I'm like I  agree with you I know these guys are  good players individually think be but  if you are trolling 50% of your games  you're a bad player like you're a 50%  player then if you if you're trolling  half the time then that's that's you  medus is on the campaign Trail here he's  doing some good work for clown9 but like  okay they're not immune to criticism  like I think I think re for blabber is  not his best Champion like I'm I'm a  blabber stand agre that's not his reals  look pretty rough like he never runs hex  flash on real he he hasn't even been  ganking though which has been bizarre  yeah I mean that that's the thing like  to me re is a contracts Champion 100%  like re is great if you're looking to  play around your lanes to not just like  yeah she's got good clear speed but  you're playing well so getting super  ahead doesn't actually do anything uh  you really want hex flash to make more  plays happen so I think he's just kind  of slotting re into the way he regularly  plays Jungle which is kind of like a  more carry style which you know I I  don't think that works too well I don't  think that's what you want weird because  he's he's like one of his most  successful Champions has been like maai  and stuff right like he can play that  style of champ so I don't I don't know  but it has has been not not Rift maker  Malai that was the most garbage build of  all time um but I mean yeah I think that  Cloud9 can absolutely bounce back from  this I think they're insanely talented  but I also think we can't Overlook okay  clearly there's drafting issues but also  I mean to me the worst bot Lane thing  that I've seen in a while it felt like  from players of this quality was the one  against uh fly Quest where it wasn't  even I think it was the the initial dive  they trolled the dive and died but there  was this one fight afterwards that  actually just tilted me off the face of  the planet where they were looking for  this 2v2 and people were talking about  oh like um buio swept so it took Vision  away from the ward in in the in the bush  and maybe he berser could have finished  all but yeah but it's like so maybe he  could have traed the kill maybe but he  loses three waves like and it would have  been a one for one like it was there's  just no world in which it is good right  like that wasn't even execution that was  just like you are tilted for sure you're  that was that was a tilt play for sure  yeah there's just no way you fight there  ever right if we're tilted and trolling  half the time then we're 50% players I'm  just it's fine man turn it on when it  matters they seem so inactive in the  early game which is one of the things  that really I felt was bizarre watching  three St games I think it was the  Mortals game that was C with flowers and  we were 31 minutes in and I think Cloud9  has zero kills it it was 1 to zero at  like 31 minutes I don't think I'm  exaggerating no I think you're right I  remember I I was going through the  scores and I think it was like that game  ended like six to1 in kills or something  in two of cloud n's losses they had  players with zero deaths which yeah is  pretty they just weren't even trying  place which is bizarre because I always  think of Cloud9 as as one of the more  like proactive teams the teams that like  is going to go down without a fight if  they start losing they're going to make  things H they're going to try you know  what I mean um but yeah that was one of  the weirdest Parts about all these  losses for me was it just felt like they  kind of just sat back and I don't know  if they were just thinking okay my  opponent's going to make a mistake and  then we're going to capitalize on it  let's just keep waiting they're going to  make a mistake they're going to make  mistake they're mistake and then they  just didn't or what the plan was like I  don't know what the comms were there or  if they thought that they were going to  like outscale and they didn't need to  fight or what but yeah those games were  wildly inactive and it it is pretty  shocking uh um how how this team has  looked over the last four games because  they've looked really bad over the last  four games they've definitely not looked  good I'm just going to say let's wait to  see them on a game where they're not  horrendously outd drafted before we jump  to any  conclusions I I was going to say too I  did see the ashle king interview that  you're talking about with Jojo and he  was supremely confident he was saying  all the same things as you he was like  yeah we're just trolling we he said that  we have the best players in every role  he was like we you know as soon as we  work together a little bit and as soon  as we fix our draft then everything's  going to be fine I do think like you  know when you're on a team you have to  project that type of confidence but they  should also as long as they are also  examining these games and and you know  in review and making sure taking steps  to make sure that you don't make these  types of mistakes or and working out  communication you know whatever it's  going to be rubric for for the games so  that you don't make some of these calls  or you can put a stop to some of these  calls before they happen  and as long as they're examining the  losses so that they don't happen again  rather than just being like ah we were  trolling it's not going to happen again  because if you just say that then it  probably will good review guys high five  ah we were trolling review done which I  don't think that they would be doing  that I mean I I will say I'm still  giving them definitely benefited out I  would not be shocked if they still won  because the amount of on this team but  it does start to feel a little bit like  fly quest in summer we like well they  were so good in Spring they're going to  turn it around guys they're going to  turn of course they're well next week  for sure well playoffs come on guys you  know and it's like at a certain point  you have to do it and um and the season  goes really really fast it's a six week  season we are halfway done if they if  they have another 02 week or something  then there's not going to really be any  time to turn it around so I think they  have to start making it work but should  we jump on to Immortals who had uh a  good weekend they went two- one this  weekend um which was pretty exciting and  I think the only loss that they had I  felt it was a pretty big draft Gap and I  think sharks even tweeted out you know  my bad kind of trolled the draft or  whatever because that one was uh if I  I'm looking back yeah it was the double  they basically they had Zack top they  had uh re TK Senna and then Jace so they  basically had two lethality damage  dealers and then they're playing against  Cante and uh and poy and I just remember  sniper walking at their backline 1 V2  all game long and they can't even move  his health right so like that one felt  doomed from draft for me but the other  two games they won and they look pretty  solid I mean wins against energy and  Cloud9 that's that's good two of the  worst teams in the league two of the  worst teams yeah I mean uh good for that  Energy's died for a second okay let's  let's  relax yeah he on super leue performance  that's a zero3 team and a one two team  Kobe it is uh I didn't want to like  interrupt your flow but real real quick  on that cuz I thought it was cool Medio  said he would still predict Cloud9 to  win bet if I was going to predict right  now I would I would definitely take the  field if you're going to give me the  field but I I would I would you like to  be involved in your first ever dive bet  we've had a proud history of having to  do ice baths and wear embarrassing  cosplay and other things I mean I would  bet depending on the stakes I don't know  if I want ice  bath uh all right what what Stakes  should we maybe we have to determine  Stakes later though cuz German Stakes  we'll come back to if you guys are  willing to do a  bet won't be big Stakes okay okay you  can't take the field though you got to  take a team can I get two teams you can  have two teams okay I'll take energy and  fly Quest okay that's a bet all right  we'll we'll we'll we'll come up with the  Stak we'll have the stakes for next week  okay that they'll agree upon because we  don't want to waste too much time  thinking about that but there you go  first bet uh just for fun what would  what would your team to predict if I had  take two teams if you could predict  right now would you predict predict  Cloud9 or would you take two other teams  I would still predict Cloud9 okay I I I  still I still have now we get a test  wait do you want in on the BET how does  that even work either well depending on  the on the rewards either both of you  lose or both of you win and I'm the only  one who who cares all right we're in  there um yeah I mean you probably have  better odds I think yours is the smarter  bet but but if I was but you you asked  me if I want to pick one team but I  either way I I still believe they get  they could turn it around um yeah  Immortals Immortals I think has been  doing a lot better it's also fun for me  to see a team that everyone was like  this team is trash actually do well and  not only pick up some wins but put up  fights and some of their losses also um  it was kind of cool I actually went I  saw some of their scrims um flowers I  went into their compound last week  before their games um on the day before  super week uh and then they they won the  next day and they're like well you guys  are come back next week right um but  yeah no it was It was kind of cool  seeing some of the things that they were  working on and even some of the things  that we saw them practicing in scrims  then bring out on stage uh not all of it  worked and not all of it worked like the  way that they were talking about in  scrims but it was it was interesting to  see some of the stuff that they were  working on like as a squad some of the  things that they were focusing on can  you share what things anything  interesting I mean you leak all their  pics I me definitely leak all the pics  uh I mean I think I I would say that one  of the really big things that they were  focusing on was was communication and um  I I think this would be fine for me to  share is just like for example like  their they were all like communicating  pretty well as far as just like General  stuff but they wanted to be really  focused on more like what the goals  needed to be in the game so it's like  more talking about like what you need as  a player to succeed in the game versus  like what is happening like everyone's I  think was talking a lot about like okay  you know he's going to be there this is  happening now I'm going to reset you  know they're talking about that stuff  but I think they were trying to like  really improve on okay how do we win  this game okay we need to get the dragon  so then we need to be talking about okay  how do we get the dragon so then we need  to be talking about okay when are we we  going to base what our base timing is  going to be how are we going to set up  vision and like where do you need a ward  for a flank you know all these sorts of  things those kind of next steps because  it felt like all the players watching  them were actually doing really well  individually like as far as the scrims  were going mechanically they all seemed  like they were doing well like  everything was working but they felt  like that next step was what they were  trying to work towards is really being  cohesive on where they want to go in the  game and how to get there and so I think  it was kind of fun to see that and it'll  be interesting to see if they can you  know like watching them through that  lens I could kind of see how they were  trying to work on that on stage yeah I  kind of miss the the scrim culture I  guess in that way uh cuz I did something  similar with C9 like a week or two ago Y  where I was just stopping by the house  to like talk to Jack and a scrim was  going on so I just watched the game and  like it it really brought back a lot of  good memories for me just like the stuff  that happens in scrims that like you  don't really see outside of it like I  don't know people just like getting  really tilted just like crazy allins  that you would never see otherwise it's  just like Yep this is a scrim there  there are some pretty there's some  pretty troll scrims I would say there at  least the scrims I watched were pretty  disciplined overall but there was one  like five minute remake that was pretty  funny where it was just an all out brawl  yeah you'll see that it's like I it used  to be it's probably still the case if  gang blink ever comes back into the meta  like my God it's it's so demonic bro  like the game will be decided by level  one Top Lane someone's winning or going  Z1 like there was a this game that lives  rentree in my head and I can probably  talk about it cuz there's long time ago  now it was an echo fox versus CLG scrim  from forever ago right yeah it was every  game and I watched this whole scrim  block and it was like game one level one  fight to the death between him and I  think it was like Dara or something at  the time this level one fight to the  death remake game two uh there's like a  fiveman invade for for red buff and the  other team's fiveman stacked at Red buff  both top laners die both TP back to the  level one fight and I'm just like  there's no way you would do this you  could never convince me in a million  years they would be tping back and it  was it was like the the blue team's red  buff so it's bot Lane that their team  being back to basically like and I was  just like it was so funny man into an  instant remake into game three was a  level one fight to death  into great info gained I I swear like  literally back in our first LCS split  there was uh you know the team they had  like a ton of different names like  Vulcan xdg and stuff but but that team  we would have the most curs scrims  against them like I remember one time it  was like an hour of straight remakes it  would be like we were just level one  fighting each other to the death every  time and I'm sitting there like guys  what are we doing like this is such a  waste of time and and then and lemon  were like no they don't win this fight  if they take this fight we're fighting  him I'm just like bro this is literally  never going to happen in a game like  what are we  doing it was crazy it so funny uh yeah  there's some there's some really funny  stories from scrims but I I will say in  the scrims I've watched in recent years  overall all I feel like people are more  disciplined than the the wild west days  that I used to watch them in dude I I  gotten the most arguments probably like  90% of my arguments were just with  teammates doing things that I'm like  you're not going to do this on stage  like you're griefing us and our our  scrim opponents like I would literally  be like dude this team's not going to  play against us again if we're doing  this like this is so ridiculous please  stop yeah it is really really funny and  some teams do lose scrim Partners I know  if they're if they're trolling too hard  especially if you're a lower ranked team  it becomes a bit of like a privilege to  play the higher ranked teams you know  cuz they have their scrim Bubbles and  you can get dropped as a scrim partner  if you're trolling too hard cuz if  you're wasting their time next one  people talk a lot about that at Worlds  and I know there were some teams that  were like oh man but then the the  Eastern teams are always going to beat  us in these level ones and we're always  going to lose from there so that's why  we have to do this we have to test our  Extremes in the level ones and the Allin  it's like you really stage no nope wrong  I think I think for those things to me  that is always stood out as something  that's like you don't need to fight till  the death level one in a five versus  five scrim just get into a custom game  and run to level ones if you if you must  figure out if GP and Renekton Auto  attack each other to death at level one  who wins then go do it but like don't  waste everyone else's time with it do it  in a custom game one-on-one uh but that  stuff was pretty funny we got a little  bit off track but yeah Immortals  Immortals per has has been fun to watch  and that has been one of the things that  I think has been the biggest pleasant  surprise for me is that you know teams  like Mortals in Shopify and DS that I  didn't really expect a lot from and even  Hunter thieves as well who has done even  better than that uh they are all feeling  competitive even if they are losing none  of the games just feel like this given  game where there's a lot usually like  when you're looking at strength of  schedule in in previous splits almost  every split you look three and you're  like okay well this is this is like  first versus eth or like this is second  versus ninth or whatever you're like  okay well that's a guaranteed win this  is a guaranteed win this is a guaranteed  win when I'm looking at strength of  schedule I don't really feel like that  with pretty much any of the games cuz  everyone is kind of at least showing  that they can be competitive even if  they can't close close out wins 100% I  mean even just looking at the standings  there's there's no zero7 team the worse  is two and five which that's super close  two games between second and seventh  yeah and it shows in the games too it's  not just like oh you know this is how it  turned out with the with the wins and  the losses like there are a lot of  really really competitive moments and  that's what the conversation about that  LCS being a very competitive league this  year um I feel like just shows up in  every single weekend that we have yeah  and hopefully it'll continue being that  way um down in seventh is Shopify and  dignitas who are both winning one and  two this weekend they're both two and  five shopify's two wins are against  energy and  C9 um again the worst teams in the  league you know the easy easy teams they  both had Scion mid as well which I mean  and uder  top interesting the tanks I don't love  it like you know it's kind of what we're  saying about TL is like I don't think  just winning in one way is super  beneficial to your team especially when  mid doesn't count and losing with Lucian  doesn't count kind of like like kind of  kind of uh I don't know it it just  doesn't feel like solid gameplay it kind  of feels like you're cheesing them which  not to take away from them I don't think  Shopify is bad by any means I just think  that uh I would like to see them play a  little bit more normal I don't think you  need to try to cheese everyone you ever  play um and I would like to see how they  do with a more standard game plan I mean  I I think it's fine to have this as uh  one of your strategies but it can only  be one like I was saying earlier if you  keep doing the same thing even if it's  something that nobody else is doing  people are going to recognize that  pattern and they're going to build  counters specifically for you like  hundred thieves did and dump on you so  going to be playing against you've  already you've already used up your  surprise Factor so unless you have  another iteration or you are the one  ready with Innovations and and  corrections to what you think people are  going to try and play into you then  you're going to you're really going to  lose out because then you become the  predictable one and you're kind of  making your opponent be the creative one  by coming with their counter already  prepared for you so that's my biggest  worry I guess for Shopify and the thing  that's going to hinge on this week's  practice the most uh how much work they  put into actually regaining the surprise  Factor or the upper hand in them knowing  their strategy better than you do  because if you know their strategy just  as well as they do uh and have a and pre  and come with a counter then it's going  to fail yeah like I would push back a  little bit on on like the cheese win  stuff because I don't think there's  anything wrong inherently with just like  playing off meta but I do think I agree  in that you can't just play the same  thing every time like when Insanity last  split was playing off meta stuff he was  playing like Graves mid and things that  were wildly different right so to me  it's like if he just wants to be play  never play a single game of his year  this whole split and he's just going to  play different stuff I think that's fine  but if you're just going to be doing the  same thing every time then yeah people  are going to pre- counter it and it's  going to become a problem but it's like  if he wants to if he wants to go from  Sion mid and then next week he's playing  like brand and zerth and you know velos  and whatever it's like okay I I will  make the distinction I think there's a  pretty big difference between those kind  of like artillery Mages and Scion and  garz like you know no offense to  Insanity uh but those are like that's  the champ I would put my mid laner on if  like he's just worse than all my  opponents right like if I was a jungler  and I somehow got autofilled into LCS  mid I'd be like give me something easy  just give me something that I will not  rolled over on or I can still be useful  even if I get rolled on because like  Canon's not really winning Lane against  anything he's just kind of enduring the  laning phase and then being useful  afterwards and I know insanity is a good  player like he if he wants to play  Innovative picks great I have no issue  with that I think it's just like when  you're trying to just take the easy way  out and pick some nonp punishable champ  that's kind of like eh that's only going  to get you so far to play Devil's  Advocate do you do you still think it's  basically like incorrect if their read  is just that tank itemization is so op  that it's actually like this is actually  just the best way to play the game I  mean if if they truly believe that then  right I don't think it's wrong but I  think that that's probably not the case  yeah and I think they're making them  their comp worse by also picking the  Cante and an Nautilus with a Scion game  then you could running three of these  low damage tanks and I mean this example  of the 100 thieves game is just the the  most like lopsided example that I could  pull from because that was a really good  drop at 100 thev so smart not only is it  the atrox but they also have the Lilia  to annihilate both of them with  leandre's uh and passive stacking and  they have Olaf for Sniper it's like  every single person and then they back  up all these short range melees with a  senat Lane and you're just like oh my  God this is the perfect anti- Shopify  Rebellion strategy and then they even  triple down on the tanks without damage  type of type of build here for them so I  feel like they even more self- countered  it was it was really interesting though  because I I remember even in that game  um Boogie got what was it three or four  early kills on the brand I can't  remember how many but he got some early  kills and APA was casting the game and  they're they're asking him oh which  which team do you think has the better  spot and he was like basically saying he  thought shop five was going to win for  sure MH that he thought they they had a  better spot that brand was just going to  win the game basically um so it's it's  interesting right so it's like even in  that that game they like at least APA  still believed that there was a way  dise yeah you never believed I disagree  watching the game you never believe no I  was maybe it's because I I just have had  so many scenarios where you just you get  to the point where the Champions that  are like drain tanks get to run through  pure Tank teams and Lilia atrox and Olaf  are all those classification of the  healing drain tanky do way more damage  than a tank but also annihilate them  class and they have good ways to  actually pressure and kill brand as well  yeah and you've got a Sen Tom kench too  even even if one of them does Get Low  you have a Tom kench and the Senate  healing and shielding I was just like oh  my God this is this is crazy that tough  I was like damn golden glue is a genius  yeah well we'll see we'll see if shop  Cooks up anything new this weekend or if  they're going to continue on the tank  train uh dig toss the last team down at  1 and two this weekend um you know  they're a team I feel like I I still  would say they're overperforming  expectations um but I think they're the  team that people have the least hope for  I don't know if you guys agree with that  I I was actually going to say I have  them up there with 100 thieves as far as  surpassing my expectations cuz I think  even though dick hasn't been winning a  lot of their games like they are  competitive they they're playing a  pretty good game even when they don't  manage to win XU has impressed me a lot  almost every game he's going for some  kind of early invade like take my  Raptors walk into your jungle scrap With  the Enemy jungle like XU has been really  good and I know going back to our didn't  you put them Eights on the jungle T and  I I was P XU yeah but like it's it's not  like eight means he's bad it just means  everyone's good and somebody's got to be  eth and I haven't seen him enough but  he's been really impressive to me did he  move up in the tier list what's the  updated power ranking for XU I dude want  to put m in the same tier like it's e  Toth that's the new update no I'd maybe  move him up but who else is going to be  eth then I don't know man but he's been  good he's been really good especially  for a new player I like the confidence  he plays with obviously not perfect he  Mak some mistakes like anybody but I I  just like watching the way they play  they've been kind of doing their own  thing with picks as well they're not um  just sticking to one style but I think  this is actually a team that I have uh I  have hope for I think that you think  they could go up and I don't think  there's any match dig is going to go  into where I'm like yeah they're just  GNA get rolled there's there I don't  feel about any team I don't feel like  that for any team which is yeah comes  back to like the the competitive LCS  split that we're having but yeah I I  guess Immortals and dig are the two  examples of coming into the split where  pretty much everybody's you're just so  used to like oh yeah those are throwaway  games I definitely agree with you I  don't feel I don't feel like that for  immortals games anymore I don't feel  like that for TOS games at all I will  say one thing I'm I'm kind of  disappointed with and maybe this is  coloring my my perception a little bit  is that I had higher expectations for  Rich I thought Rich was actually really  good last split or last year I guess it  was overall um this split I feel like he  hasn't been performing yearly as well he  has not been nearly as much of a  standout um for me so I feel like Dove  and exu and and stuff have definitely  overperformed compared to where I  expected but I felt like rich is kind of  underperformed and I I guess I struggled  to see them climbing the sings I do  think that they're competitive but yeah  you also think Dove has overperformed  expectations uh well I feel like  people's expectations for him was that  he was going to be really trash so yeah  I would say so  okay I mean is that wrong I feel like  everyone was flaming this guy when dius  announced the the pickup yeah I guess  people only yeah people were telling me  that he's like not even like not even  deserving to be in any tier one League  period let alone let alone like be a  decent mid lader the league yeah I mean  it's tough to say I guess I hadn't heard  much about him at all good or bad which  you know from lot of people I've talked  to is kind of similar so I think he's  done all right you know nothing crazy uh  he's had some standout performances like  some good plays also some some ins but  uh I I don't have any strong opinion on  him either way yet one thing interesting  is that rich hasn't played any uder and  I know he's lost against uder a lot so  what's really weird about about that is  he was one of the ones spamming it in  Champs Q too so I was coming into this  thinking that dig were going to have a  high priority on it and they just  haven't so I yeah I also thought that  was weird um he also hasn't like last  year he was doing Quinn counter picks  and all these like Lane bully counter  picks yeah Quinn ala stuff yeah that I  was kind of hoping for for a bit more  especially because the way they changed  Top Lane this year where it's harder to  gank you know you're more isolated I was  like oh this is going to be even better  for dignitas and Rich's style of let me  get a kind of isolated counterpick V top  has been uh pretty popular in solu also  stuff like that you know where you're  you're going to try and be abusive I  don't know and and isolated but he stuff  we had atrox gragas rumble or Poppy and  Nar Nar the Nar one I think was a  counterpick Nar which um you know had  the possibilities of being cool but I  don't think that Champ's very good hro  is another one that's kind of looking  like a bait pick at this point he's lost  like I love the profane  Hydra I feel like it does bad in every  game I'm with you man I think atrox has  been looking awful in Top Lane I think I  I don't know if the Champion's like  insane or not I think people might be  building him into like the profane Hydro  lethality in situations where you might  not want that I think there are times  where it's good you know if you're  really ahead but if it's the default  that you're going to every single game  because I see so many fights where atro  just goes in and just gets one shot and  that's not very good though especially  there have been a lot where they have no  tank jungle and no tank support I feel  like every time there's there's that  scenario you should be the Bruiser build  yeah you need your entry frager you need  like the guy who just goes in like  before it worked well with Gore drinker  but like now you can kind of do with  like sunro Sky uh ster type items like  you need someone who can just go in tank  their spells and hopefully not instantly  die yeah I mean to to me hoox is getting  picked all the time as an answer into  uder they just build lethality lose Lane  generally or go even at at best into  uder and then they have this like super  tank on the other side that's just  running around slowing everyone stunning  everyone HX never feels like it's  getting those highlight moments there's  so much peel in the game I feel like  right now as well um that it's very  difficult for him to without setup like  you guys are talking about so I don't  know I mean maybe it's a build thing  maybe it's just a matchup thing maybe  it's just an uder so strong thing but  like you know uder and atrox are on two  opposite ends of the spectrum as far as  how Top Lane picks are performing uh  udor is 83% win rate hro is 22% win rate  in the LCS and yeah I just feel like  udar has been looking and one of those  atrox games is mid- atrox from quidd  this is specifically top unless you  highlight it only top cuz like there  there have been some good atrox picks  but yeah they have been a lot fewer and  and usually the ones that I like are  when they do have engage from Jungle or  support and yeah the uh the winds have  been from Castle on Immortals two of  yeah everyone else who's tried a truck  has lost and I think that you know like  you were saying Aro does play that like  tanky engage style which obviously is  going to enable a TRS a lot better than  some other stuff yep well it's been a  really fun split so far I've been  enjoying it a lot I hope that we keep up  the the compet the competitiveness and I  hope that it's not just one of those  things where it's just like okay and  everything went back to how you expected  it right in the second half um but it's  going to be fun uh remember that is  going to be wrapping up for us for now  um but if you're

on how have you been great how how  are how are you I've seen you around  with Shopify mhm Shopify has been great  coaching the team hanging out on the  sidelines losing week one you know it  was  good  you forgot to mention one thing what it  was your damn birthday yesterday it was  it was I'm 29 now let's go you're oldest  H I love that picture yeah it's really  funny what did you end up doing  yesterday oh just hanging out watching a  movie just chilling eating dinner going  to sleep I don't know so you're more  lowke Keepers cuz for me I just don't  generally tell people when it's my  birthday and I do nothing I don't really  celebrate my birthday I just play video  games historically I just play video  games and like you know blast playing  Lego or something yeah uh there is some  there's some tape online though of what  else you've been up to yes yes it's a  it's a video Shopify film for us check  it out let's  goally a meal we challenged wild turtle  and Tomo to grocery shop with a $25  budget but what they didn't know was  that they had to make a meal out of  their purchases let the best Shopper win  all right let's get a  basket yeah specifically blueberries why  are these ones so large they're like GMO  favorite type of you know I'm just going  to get roasted turkey call me weird if  you'd like part of the challeng is to  make a meal out of your materials you  have 20 minutes and your time starts now  I'm going to put them down individually  and that's it guys ladies and gentlemen  the final  product hello hello everybody it's me Mr  turtle and here is my dish the wild  turkey the thing about a pumpkin  chocolate chip is a well I just wanted  to get some chocolate chips at the  grocery store and The Raspberries a  great source of fiber and vitamin C and  you know this blueberry is Jed out of  its mind so I'm sure it's also pretty  good I got the proteins from the cliff  bar and let me know what you  think  oo that's pretty solid is that me  wrapping the  cookie it was a pumpkin cookie I didn't  even know what I was getting I thought  it was chocolate chip it just happened  to be  pumpkin you ate it right yeah I ate it  all all it it was fine it was okay just  didn't expect it to be pumpkin flavored  I bathroom trip half  your I would not be a good  trip I knew it was over when you spent  half of your budget on coffee I was like  oh no oh I didn't realize we had to like  make food it was a bait and switch yeah  it was a bait and switch yes yes anyways  new patch uh we'll see what teams have  been cooking up because we are on the  live patch we're the only professional  League major region in the world that  will be on 14.3 and see that little  dragon that's smolder I see him oh old  there we can play smolder today today  nice teams can play smolder or a reling  soul hot fix reling Soul true but  they've had just as much time to adjust  to this stuff as the people at home we  got to pick all the dragons now like  shyana asil the full Dragon full Dragon  comp Year of the Dragon something like  that yeah dragon fist Le in let's pass  let's look at the at the overview of  what's happened so far because obviously  smolder has been released asol had a  bunch of changes Karma eal nerfed what  stands out uh Emily to you so far in the  patch Zar is back or she might be  back yeah we don't know I mean she was  kind of getting picked in like some  outlier cases uh and then obviously I'm  not going to necessarily take what  happened in NAC yesterday uh because  they were actually the first  or like development league on the patch  yeah but they're also in Fearless draft  so it makes sense uh this is obviously  uh one of our best Zer players in the  league right now in Berserker and people  are kind of wondering with the Zer Buffs  to this patch um whether it is enough  for to see something like this out of C9  because historically this has been a  champion on which Berserker has been  able to Showcase his team fighting  prowess uh as as you see she had base a  debuffs and uh a cool down reduction on  her ultimate so um I mean I I think Zer  was kind of getting picked in outlier  situations anyway with the  metric like ton of botling bands we've  seen across the board these are really  solid Buffs but also I think the items  um like the Kraken Slayer and the static  sh is actually a really good addition to  like static sh losing 300 gold on the  purch price is pretty pretty amazing to  get for her yeah and you you want to  build that early on Zer yeah you just  get it and then you can Farm even faster  than before um a little questionable  about the hex play I don't know if it's  a good item on Ziri quite yet but I  prefer getting navori second still so  you think she's in a good spot right now  yeah well I always kind of liked Zer I  don't know if you if anyone's been  watching my streams but I play zeri like  24/7 almost so oh then you're perfect  for today if she ends up coming out um  for me uh like it's going to be  interesting with a lot of I guess newer  things being thrown bot Lane overall  like yes we already talked about smolder  coming through a weaker laner overall  and I wonder if people are going to  prioritize the pick and if they can  protect it uh to me the patch changes  that I'm interested in is actually like  the karma Nerfs umh because she was  thrusted into the meta with pretty large  ratio changes to make her uh pretty  difficult to deal with at least in the  draft because people expected  immediately that they' be playing Karma  mid uh with malignants maybe even like  Top Lane but a lot of teams ended up  flexing it to the bot Lane with Ezreal  and so the Buffs to Ezreal the buff to  certain items like uh to like I guess  the um Essence Reaver items in the  previous patch like it made it so oh  suddenly this is a really good Lane to  play but I think she is still in a good  spot I still think you it's really  difficult to draft against a team that's  willing to three-way Flex the karma so  even though it did hit her I think she's  still in a good spot yeah I think last  week Karma was more banned than picked  so like we only saw it bot Lan but it  was banned and on almost every game so I  don't think Karma or Ezreal are  necessarily dead like when I look at the  win rate magnitude on like the stat  sites that you see online they didn't do  that much to move the needle down  especially if teams are practicing it  last week uh really quickly I do want to  we have the graphic now I want to pull  up the full patch notes to give like a  brief overview of the number of changes  and the number of items that were  actually hit because Turtle you already  mentioned that the itemization is going  to be changing things uh so you can see  like the system changes up at the top  right huge amounts of item changes uh  decent amount of Nerfs a lot of Buffs  some of the adjustments they say  adjustments where they're not really oh  my God the allow ones are Buffs guys I'm  sometimes it turns out to be a massive  buff like the maai one as well only hit  his win right by like 1% so I think 's  still going to be a support there one  thing I want to zero in on though you  can see up in the Buffs it goes ASO NY  and then  Pike luo so buio he won player of the  week last week so he was riding High uh  he he gains some followers on social  media by basically saying that he will  pick Pike if he gets to 10,000 oh he got  to 10,000 there it is and he had this to  say he's gonna pick Pike right you guys  so much for 10,000 followers on Twitter  hope you guys are excited to see Pike  this  weekend won't again hope you guys are  excited to see  bike these are the pike changes uh a lot  of line items I think overall it's a for  me a fairly minor buff the E damage  going up is much later in the game so I  don't think that's going to have of a  massive impact I'm actually just a  little curious Turtle as the coach shop  fire Bellion do you like that they're  maybe sleeping on Shopify a little bit  saying they're going to play Pike making  meane videos about it does that the task  at hand to beat Shopify Rebellion today  I mean I do hope they pick Pike you know  like I don't know if this Champion is  that good it did receive some Buffs the  w one's pretty big actually I think this  movement speed is actually pretty large  um but yeah I hope they do pick bike and  we can punish it all I'm saying was I  was watching some solo qu games I saw an  Alo Pike in Solo Q I'm just putting it  out there people are practicing it boo  trying to make the case to Nuke duck a  few supports just want to pick it  because it's fun and also the Buffs look  nice I mean he is really fun though it's  like really hard to kill and you can  just kind of walk wherever you want take  all the wards it's pretty enjoyable and  I will be unfollowing buio who doesn't  pick Pike because that was the deal he  said if he gets 10,000 followers he's  going to lock it in so he better this  week uh one final not on the patch Nico  is disabled due to visual bug it was  introduced in 14.3 we asked Leos because  we want to describe it they said we're  not telling you because we don't want  you doing solo que so just know that  we're not going to see Nico I wanted to  abuse the bug that's all we know we just  don't know uh in addition to the past  changes remember smolder is now enabled  in the LCS so let's check in with Yan  and masu for a rundown on  smolder hey guys it's Yan from Team  Liquid hey I'm masu Fest ADC and here's  some smolder  tips the very newb friendly Tech with  smolder these days is Comet manifold  bands absolute Focus scorge this is very  easy to get out of lane cuz in my  opinion smolder is a very scaling  Champion he's not very a lan heavy  dominant Champion where you want to like  brute force and duel people and fight  them I thought his laning phase should  be pretty weak but  then people discovered that you can just  start W and go com it and start  Ding and now I'm not so sure if his Lane  is weak so when the lane comes out like  this your main goal is to push the wave  as much as you can cuz your cool Downs  are very long and hit them as well as  you can so let's say they're here then  you want to W here if they're like here  you want to move a little bit and push  like this but in this case you push like  that and then you have a really decent  wave player so you can just do this and  because of how wide it is and how like  hard it is to miss you're basically  guaranteed to hit like somebody in Lane  which gives you a stack and keep in mind  you don't in my opinion you don't want  to auto trade that much because you  don't have like  a high ad with this there's always one  secret mechanic that people fail to  recognize like one very small very very  small one like a lot of people will use  this is like you can like glitch out of  the wall  anytime like let's say I'm hovering this  wall you can like keep glitching back  and forth towards the  end so you can like utilize how much  you're actually hitting them here like  one two and then at the end cuz it  actually ended here you know I try to  like see their numbers in game see how  strong they actually are early game how  hard do they scale into that game and  how easy is it to transition I think the  damage is very strong but I don't like  that it will lose a lot of Duss I think  how much his does was pretty surprising  at first because if you hit the center  at like level six it does close to like  300 damage I think the ultimate is very  strong like look how far it goes  mom these are my thoughts thanks for  watching smolder are we going to see  smolder that's kind of all chat wants we  will for sure see smolder for sure for  sure you're  guaranteeing Insanity gonna I do have  scam  LS um I mean again it is fearless draft  so obviously certain things get banned  out but we did see uh a bunch of smolder  in the NAC  yesterday um specifically smolder mid  seemed to end up being more successful  than smolder bot of like the sample size  um but teams were more than willing to  lock it in because once you hit 225  Stacks you actually just take over the  game yeah and when I was looking at some  of just the solo qu data uh there are a  lot of optimizations with the champion  like being able to know the damage of  your queue to stack faster is a  massively important optimization so  depending on your your ELO so like it  basically the highest Winer was Diamond  then Emerald then gold then silver in  terms of how good you are at smolder so  even the diamond I saw is already up  over 50% for a new Champion which to me  is like all right then like we're we're  almost certainly going to see it once I  once I see that I personally don't know  all the optimizations yet but what were  you going to say yeah I was about to say  cuz like with the the filming that we  had right there was actually it was last  week last week when it just released EX  so I'm sure their opinions have changed  on this one even to the point of like  the Rune changes like for me I I saw PTA  as a pretty nice Rune because Q procs  PTA at least it has one single proc on  it so you can Auto q auto and you can  get the PTA proc instantly so like  what's your experiences off of plays and  SC um after playing smaller myself too I  think the meteor build is just more op  just because when you land that first W  in Lane it's just like 170 damage and  it's near impossible to miss like w it's  just you're a noob if you're missing it  I'm sorry but but it's just easy to land  and if you hit Champions you get a stack  yeah you get a stack too so that's a  strong part I see a lot of people doing  like um three points in W and the Max  and q y so that's uh pretty popular  right now because one thing I did learn  and I'm sure everyone probably knows  this by now but once your three points W  and you have 25 stacks of Q you w the  back wave Q once you get three stacks  every single time so you push fast you  get Stacks fast uh Emily you mentioned  that Poss I'm pretty sure you can do the  same thing cuz like we were watching LEC  earlier we like whoa Senna got a lot of  souls off the MIT basically I'm pretty  sure each of those counts as a stack  yeah the little baby tiny kugs all give  you a stack as well so you can go kill  kugs and get like eight or 10 but at the  end of the day like it's like 20 minutes  until you're at 225 Stacks so it's  really hard like when do you fight no I  think like at least with the scrims I've  been watching too it takes around like  25 26 minutes to get like fully stacked  too and there's a lot of action so when  you get pulled away from you know  farming the creeps it could be how weak  are you before 26 I personally think  it's a pretty weak Champion it's like it  specializes in like kind of like Zone  controlling and just getting like a good  ultimate mm man it's GNA be I I think  Fleet is decent but I the comic build  makes sense yeah I don't know if Fleet  St maybe I need to play it's like  sustain it's just like depending on how  how rough you think the laning phase is  going to be do you think it's going to  go any other lane because uh you're  right about there being a lot of people  trying mid lane I actually when I was  watching and doing a lot of research I  was like watching Nemesis and he thinks  it's broken but also he's just playing  it a lot through mid sure um so it's  interesting to know that it's just it  can be used as a flex pick and I think  that will teeter it over to being abused  in uh competitive if people are willing  to flex it as as much as they uh think  it's good when I was checking the stats  highest solo K win rate was bought and  then it was about 3% lower in mid and in  top yeah um but Loro has been streaming  it a lot in top against like Melee  matchups and he's like oh you get get to  scale for free  and he's like he's still pretty bad at  it like if you watch him in team fights  he's just running he knows he is like  he's running around doing dumb things  just kind of having fun and he's still  actually finding a decent amount of  success because a lot of those games get  Derpy he has two and 25 stacks and it's  like he accidentally kills people like  once you get to 225 you just press it  does so it the spray is so wide I hope  we see it so we can see once you get to  225 because the difference and the  amount of damage do is just insanee yeah  I think we should have like a counter to  see who's getting it the fastest  to take over a Fast Five category May  okay uh let's check out the standings as  we move in to the second half of the  spring split regular season fly Quest  two games clear of the pack at six and  one we got a lot of four and three teams  Immortals three and four three games out  of first that's one more game out of  first and then last week and Shop fine  dig in seventh place that's your one ITT  so far today you always have to mention  Al is doing because a lot of people  thought they're going to be last and  look they're not last anyway schedule  today uh they could be last if things  don't go well because they play up  against dignitas in game two obviously  we got the championship rematch once  again energy versus Cloud9 in game one  Turtle will be joining the cast for that  one so definitely check it out and shop  fire Rebellion versus fly Quest who I  really curious to see who wild turtle  picked in that game but we'll see that  at the end of the waiting room so the  top story though yeah last week as we  saw from the standings there is there's  this like super team I heard we had like  a super team in the LCS I heard a little  I heard there were Cloud Nine yeah yeah  um but first I messed up the toss we got  to take a look what we've got on Deck  this  week  smolder smolder smolder smolder smolder  smolder smolder smolder smolder smolder  yeah smolder  smold smold guys guys guys guys guys  stop okay  smolder oh  smaller good point yeah yeah makes sense  yeah  Mom we're getting into the second half  of the round robin the biggest shocker  we have is cloud n being fifth Castle  coming around from the side blabber and  fudge into the back line mudget here in  the front he's not going to be taken  down just yet his castle kills blabber  fud's dropping low JoJo's dropping lower  oh they got him Immortals are crushing  Cloud are absolutely steam rolling of  its five dead B crumbling T the base and  had Cloud Nine their fourth straight  loss I'll just say it's C9 oh yeah so  Banger yeah like a little rough for them  for sure they're a little bit too lost  in this sa on draft and they're not  actually working as a unit unit to like  get wins they're just playing their own  Champions and hoping the game works out  after this game maybe he should just  stick to fortnite  so fly Quest they're loving it man their  jerseys are like the holographic Pokemon  card and these guys are charizarding the  league right now five and one has masu  is going to have to flash out of there  there's the heartbreaker from XU XU  trying to finish him off but masu is  King out masu is still alive and on the  other side it's Jensen taking over the  fight Berserker Under Pressure having a  flash away aio's ready to follow  berserker's barely hanging on but he  gets buried underneath the anchor  Berserker and Vulcan dying in the 2v2  masu makes sure he gets some bow here  comes the damage and oh the ulti by n  pops up the kalista and he gets taken  down a being pushed back and the emperor  divide multiplies the kills and it's a  triple heading on over to masu fly Quest  our number one team in the  LCS 2024 looking to be their  year hello and welcome back uh I am  going to start cuz we're going to kind  of go around the table here at the LCS  lounge and talk about what's going on  with C9 uh so I pick draft because it's  the thing that everyone is talking about  it's a thing that everyone is always  talking about these are a few of their  team comps in wins I think this nrg1  right off the bat the last time these  two teams faced they're going to face  each other again today is kind of the  platonic ideal of what this C9 team can  do with flabber on a carry uh JoJo  holding mid you have uh a pushing varis  and then maybe fudge doesn't like it but  uh he was one of the best udar players  in terms of understanding what to proxy  when to get to the rest of the team um  they also had a really nice nocturn and  Oriana combination there um and then  we're going to go team comps and losses  cuz that's actually what everyone wants  to talk about yep um this one I actually  will defend the VIN mid this was  into uh the Scion as my sleeves always  troll me here um but I think the big  thing with a lot of these compositions  is that it comes down to execution so  obviously they had a botlan play with  these two that went not so great in that  draft and then I think think the one  that everyone is kind of talking about  because with C9 IMT I actually thought  it was because IMT very smartly  picked  Ezreal and Bard mhm into this Lane um  and I actually thought that was a really  nice as well as the ivern was just  constantly negating whatever trist  wanted to do in mid um so that's more of  an execution and then the big thing here  is I think everyone kind of finds this  draft as the most egregious one and for  me it's actually not about the Lucian or  the Milo it's about how this draft Works  into what TL had which was a massive  range Advantage with  zigs  here um so I think like for me it's less  about these drafts in a vacuum and a lot  more about execution and then also what  they are picking them into because in  the TL thing even if you are giving that  draft the benefit doubt and you're like  we have players that can execute this I  think it's a lot more difficult to  execute than what TL had and I think for  me a lot of the clues for why they have  struggled on stage showed up in early  weeks and I I'm not surprised that this  ended up happening the way it did so  let's just let's just go back a little  bit and look at their goal graphs in  their wins and their losses they're very  onedimensional games right like  everything in the wins is up and to the  right and the majority of the things in  the losses are down and to the right uh  because this one Immortals game they  just ended up getting outscaled and that  was like probably their most competitive  game but what I mean what I mean to show  here is that they're very one  dimensional games they started off very  well in the first three games they lost  the last four and I think the drafts are  one part of it because they're picking  highly early game you're going to run  over a team type drafts and that worked  for three games but when you make  mistakes with that it goes very poorly  so really quickly I have one example of  just like just to remind people here's  one where it worked out well right so  their their first game against 100  thieves a gank in the Top Lane against  sniper they get a 2v2 double kill and  then right afterwards as you can see  they even chunk out quidd and like you  can actually just straight up win a game  off of a play like this and it's  basically fudge frows the lane in the  right spot L blabber knew they were  winning the 2v2 they kind of just hands  diffed the opponents but this is like a  2,000 gold swing as well as about half  level on everyone but this also had the  bad side of it one example was bot Lane  against fly Quest this happened last  week it got completely blown open  because buio landed the nice hook onto  Berserker Berserker was in too  aggressive of a spot they killed both of  them they ran it back they killed both  of them again and then because they  don't have that many tools  they ended up just getting snowballed  out of the game so the long-winded way  of saying this is I roughly went through  all seven of their games and tried to  see what their Tendencies were and this  isn't going to be 100% accurate because  this was just my opinion but to me they  had better scaling in one of seven games  they had equal scaling in one of the  games which is why I have 1.5 I thought  they picked pushing Lanes in 17 of 21  possible pushing Lanes which is  ridiculous and the hands definition  would be where did I think they straight  out outplayed or got outplayed and this  one would be too low for the amount of  talent they have on this team because  when you're picking these win Lane comps  you actually need to consistently hands  stiff the other team to be able to get  wins so they're not picking themselves  tools I think it's because they're  running over people in scrims they're  not getting the same leads on stage and  that's why we're in this current  predicament pick it back up what you  guys have said about the ex of theirs  you mentioned of course their bad plays  that happen another thing that I would  mention is also just the bot bot Lane  dive that they had against chai overall  so the play that I wanted to show for us  un as I'll get that going here oh sorry  I believe your mic died Raz so he's been  talking to us I promise but now he's got  a hot mic okay so just piggy backing off  the bad place for the both of you guys  the bot dive on against sh Rebellion and  then on top of that what you mentioned  the 2v2 this is another example the most  recent example versus Team Liquid with  they're going up against a rro  play a r play can you guys hear me at  the time I'll just keep going so we just  roll this here as we just roll this here  the mistake has already been made here  as you look at the mini map We Have Eyes  On uder on midwave and as you can  already see both APA and umpty are  challenging JoJo Pion in blabber on the  rift H so a mistake has already been  made when both Vulcan and Berserker are  opening up on core JJ and split  themselves the TP is coming in from Nar  but he's going to be here as you can  see so the ideal play for Berserker  Vulcan and JoJo Pion are to walk up so  he's able to participate in the play  it's going to be difficult for impact to  even come in he has to walk through the  Nar to make it happen and as I clear the  screen and just show you what ends up  happening they walk away from the Nar  easier access from Impact to be able to  just Maul uh the backline of Cloud9 and  as you can tell fudge comes into the  play too late so first thing that I  wanted to focus on is if you're  committing to the rift H and you're man  down you must commit as a team and walk  away as a unit but if you're going to  take the fight you have to involve fudge  in the play and we've seen it in  basically every game where botches so  those are things that we need to look at  when they go into this game which is as  simple as execution all right we're  going to be sending it to stage in a  minute but first let's check out the  predictions wild turtle you can go up  there because you got to get ready to  cast oh yeah yeah but let's let's check  out the predictions for today all of us  say C9 is going to bounce back let's go  wow we are stand by team Discord with a  1% Edge for energy in this game one but  the uh the Cloud9 Faith runs strong here  apparently and wild turtle could not go  against his team hey respect to the  Discord for actually going for NRG it's  a 51% so a bit after party after the  games today so make sure you here at the  lounge let's send it up to the casters  to get in to game one  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  ladies and G gentlemen welcome back to  the LCS here in Spring  2024 a happy Lunar New Year to all y'all  we are about to have some more fun here  it's Saturday we're kicking off the  second round robin of this split and  we're doing it with another rematch  energy versus C9 I'm captain flowers  here with Kobe and wild turtle we got  the rain and Champs looking to stand  tall in a rematch against that super  team now in freef Fall after that dig  and Immortals are going head to-head in  a battle to climb the standings in this  split where anybody can take down  anybody game number three of the day is  going to see the battle in the Top Lane  with the new generation of Na Talent  squaring up against the old guard of the  LCS as longtime Rivals 100 thieves and  Team Liquid throw down finally we're  going to wrap it all up with the mad  scientist at the LCS having to cook up  something truly special if they're going  to take down one of the strongest teams  in the league for Shopify versus fly  Quest I'm flowers that's Kobe this is  Turtle Gentlemen let's do it let's let's  do it and a happy delayed birthday  yesterday was wild turtles birthday  happy birthday happy birthday buddy  present I got you a cast with me and  flowers nice yeah yeah yeah and  hopefully these guys are going to bring  you some top level gameplay here for  this remember the first time that we saw  these two teams go head to-head to kick  off the split it was pretty one-sided  and it was one-sided Cloud n's way yeah  I want see n to win just because you  know uh I also was talking to Cloud9  members cuz were just in makeup at the  same time as me and I was going over  patch notes and I was like oh they love  Zer and Berserker was like we're going  to win World his favorite Champion so  fingers crossed you know maybe they'll  get their hands on Zer or maybe the  smolder as well smolder today yeah I  think so I I feel like it uh the scaling  is so good because you can get to your  225 Stacks uh pretty early in the game  at least by 20 minutes most people have  been able to do it yeah we did see uh  last week as well you know a tiny bit of  darus coming out bipo trying his hand at  it so maybe it's made its way through  the scrims I don't know well still one  ban to go on Cloud9 side they could just  take that off the table if they want to  I feel like if energy is going to ban  out Darius they're kind of saying yeah  we will'll slam uder if you don't ban it  but C9 going to focus on the Twisted  Fate instead so Twisted Fate Ash Iver  banned out by C9 energy getting rid of  the Tristana the ory and the  Darius DLo with the classic hover of  auction keeping us in suspense for the  first pick and it it is that Udo  priority who could have guessed yo we  also looked at the you know the CL in  the Cloud9 victories two of the three  games were fudge on the uder it's just a  champion that is so useful uh pushing up  into enemy jungle and taking over  territory but now we're looking we're  still have this magnifying glass on the  bottom Lane and I feel like Cloud9 have  their have their pick here for  Berserker all right do they go ahead and  lock in this Varys yes they they will  okay this is something that I was kind  of hoping to see some of it's not Lucian  for C9 they definitely had some rough  performances on that they're going to  put Berserker back on the varas what is  Vulcan going to play next to him to  ensure some 2v2 success here that's what  I'm  wondering well looks like they might be  going for the answer into the uder first  to me I haven't been a huge fan of the  Cante into the udar but there are a lot  of magic resist first items you can rush  now Hollow Radiance helps you with wave  clear and uh is decent magic resist uh  for the for the Phoenix form so a lot of  people have been going that route and  just having Cante as the answer for  later all right let's see here hey since  we have our pre-recorded drafts we get  the Cloud9 chance during uh they just  got out of their practice tools everyone  was practicing up a couple of special  matchups here and getting the hype ready  so we've got the Senna locked in here  for energy FBI and who he not shy at all  about playing the ca Tom kup it's a  draft where they feel like it's a good  pick to go with let's see if they want  to go ahead and lock in that second half  or if they have something even spicier  plan to pair with the Senna yep I  wouldn't be surprised at all there it is  TK locked in how do you feel about Senna  TK TK Lanes compared to traditional ones  well Sen's got like a new build right  now she doesn't go like the support item  anymore like as the first item so she's  probably going to start the dblade and  start farming a little bit and  potentially buying the uh support item  on the first base but okay I've seen it  being skipped overall too so we'll  see if you were playing for Cloud9 um  what would you want to pair with  berserker's Varys into a senate Tom  kench that lane has so much healing yeah  it's a little bit difficult to find a  good support I think milia would be a  decent one maybe potentially Rada as  well so that's probably what I would go  for yeah Rada definitely has a good  counter  Milo well now they might also want some  engage yeah also important to keep an  eye on what's going to get banned out  the H banned out by C9 thinking okay  maybe they've got some sort of uh some  tech cooking up against the azir here in  mid lane the azir was locked in before  we got to the second half of the band so  we'll see what energy wants to look at  here the Oriana remember was already  banned out in the first half of the  draft they definitely needs you know  some good uh DPS Mage here for pal Fox I  know that Tia got buffed on this patch  both po Fox and contracts are big Tia  players so it could be a big Flex pick  for them uh jungle SL mid lane and toia  is very commonly a pick into the azir  azir has a lot of answers now since it's  the most picked Champion but the Tia  definitely is an option  there they might take the corki but  corki just got Nerf recently so yeah  there's a potential for that the  interaction between eclipse and  malignants being removed so you don't  just automatically get the get the proc  with a single rocket aali ban out Karma  who's now a multilex pick band out Quay  that can often be played in mid lane  sometimes other places but you mostly  see a mid banned out lots of mid Focus  but the final one will be that meio one  of the options you were talking about  that could be a good pairing with the  veras the ranata is still there we'll  see if C9 wants to go for that they  still have to pick both that support and  Jungle which one are they going to leave  for last my guess would be  support counter pick definitely has a  lot more value there but we're already  seeing the whole bottom Lane here with  the uh Senate TK so they lock it in wow  now B has been going with this super  tanky build too so it's one of the most  annoying supports for the rest of the  map right now um getting out there and  we'll see if ven Vulcan can actually  split up his time and try and uh try and  help out with the grubs try and help out  blabber in controlling the rest of the  map early  on energy were one of the classic combos  of having pow Fox on a kill oriented  Mage when you combine it with the vi and  that's the one I was talking about the  Tia buff coming in hot I know both these  players love this champion and when you  have a VI guaranteed setup for the  seismic shove for TOA that's a a classic  kill combo for energy it's like let's  see we've been already seeing some picks  of this if C9 wants to go for it they  could lock it  in SNY little bit less exciting yeah I  hear audible Gro from the crowd brand  come on they wanted to burn it all down  bran did get some pretty substantial  they didn't complet like kill the  champion or anything but it did bring  him a lot more in line they slowed down  the clear a little bit with some of the  brand Nerfs on this patch and so blabber  going to go with another tank Cloud9  have not had great success with him on  tanks so far this season yeah they got  all their wins when he was on you know  DPS type of Champions but they are going  to have a very very beefy front line  especially if Vulcan also builds tanky  um you know Cloud9 with very much a two  threat comp position here so Turtle let  me ask you to seeing all 10 Champions  locked in which one of these drafts  would you rather be playing now I  personally would rather be playing on  energy side I just think it's much  easier to execute like the V into the  Tia combo is just very easy UD has pry I  think balling is going to have pry too  so it seems like they have two shoving  lanes and a TOA that can run to either I  I would give the early game to energy  right now the the comp I definitely  agree because I like having the you know  the ball in your court so to speak and  energy they're the ones that have a lot  of the options for proactive moves you  know UD your top side too should have  full control there so contrax and po Fox  are definitely set up in this game to be  the ones to make some early moves try  and get those those early kills and then  later on even if VI goes too deep you  have a Tom kench on your team to to sa  her as well so I feel like they they  have a really good way to execute on  team fights Cloud9 though obviously  really good scaling there with the a so  they also can't count out the air is  that what you're doing if you're Cloud n  cuz what I'm about to ask here is you  guys are giving me the whole movie  trailer for this energy protagonist  moment here what if you do with you're  C9 what do you do if you're trying to  stop this loss streak and respond to  this draft I think for C9 they just have  to get JoJo in like a comfortable  position to potentially push waves and  get the free Farm I think when aeri gets  one or two items he can definitely hold  on to the game for them I'm a little bit  worried for Cloud9 because in a lot of  their recent losses where this team is  kind of unexplicably begun to freef fall  they have had a lack of proactive plays  and in this game it seems like that  might be the case again of course they  do have Bard and they do have Sani who  who can make some action early so maybe  they'll be able to get something going  definitely need to have uh take a little  bit more control than they have so far  this uh this season though woo all right  let's get into it see what goes down  Cloud Nine trying to fight back after a  disastrous super week I believe we have  the numbers for how long it's been since  this team has lost five games in a row  2774 days that's uh 7 point something  years a very very long time but energy  have the opportunity to make that a  reality here today you guys have already  been talking about how you expect energy  to be able to control the early game and  C9 is going to have to find some sort of  response here cuz you can see their  upcoming schedule is not going to be  definitely does not get easier from here  they did win the first time this season  though versus energy the first game of  the entire split was a Cloud9 Victory um  back in the beginning when they were  still a super  team we'll see how super they're feeling  after this one I'm going to have a lot  of eyes on this bottom Lane in  particular Berserker and Vulcan when  Berserker throut a lot of last year the  year before was being talked about as  just the bar for mechanical excellence  in the ad carry role him and Vulcan  having some rough laning phases some  tough 2v tws last week is Do's just  trying to annoy these guys the awakened  glacial attack from uder is very  obnoxious blabber losing some extra HP  there as even though it was a 2V1  defense do can still trade pretty even  yeah the North American udir have been  really really good at this constantly uh  starting out to invade enemy jungle  getting them a little bit behind there's  some early bot action oh yeah who's  hungry but Vulcan can get away there we  go one last lick and stunn bom all right  Turtle Waka through the early stages  from the point of view from the senat  Tom kench well for them they just want  to like keep the wave push oh they're  going to go for an all in here too yeah  looks like a Berserker taken low Vulcan  even lower below 200 hp there on the  support as Energy's Duo of immediately  establishes  control yeah energy just has to maintain  this control now the lane is pretty much  over I don't see how bar be is going to  get back into this  one all right constant push on bottom  side s wani is pathing down towards  bottom and contract actually just did  his red quadrant and is coming for an  invade here okay let's see if he runs  into blabber what sort of jungle  violence we get here in this blue side  quadrant for C9 instead they may just  try to turn it into a dive the wave  about to crash into the turret Vulcan  and Berserker hitting level two  contracts coming in looks for the Vol  breaker and he breaks vulcan's jaw now  Berserker under the pressure next a  little bit more damage is required oh no  it's some go he plays coming out from  energy as who he just barely gets away  from the turret shot it ends up being a  one for one trade yeah contract just  need to back out and like reset the  tower Argo there oh Berserker he's about  to drop who he's going in what about the  tongue he flashes he misses oh it's frog  legs for dinner goodbye good night  Berserker gets paid and FBI drops again  energy I don't even know what the hell  that was  as DOA versus fudge continues with the 1  one in the top side but Do's fast enough  to get away it's a 3 to one game before  4 minutes well flowers we wanted we're  looking for Cloud9 to to bounce back and  have some early moves it actually is  fully reactive though it's not them  being proactive on the plays it's it's  energy kind of spoofing the dive here  now the first kill is perfect [ __ ] it's  just that when he goes for a little bit  more here back out yeah definitely uh  you either got to just commit to it and  and get the kill on Berserker under  Tower and sacrifice your life there  because they had the ward up by Blue  buff uh to see the path down from  blabber but then yeah once who he goes  off in for it it's very difficult to  redive unless you reset the tower aggro  so yeah that was a pretty Hasty play  from contract there and I think I love  the fact that you brought it up it was  reactive Kobe this is one of those ones  that energy they full force the whole  situation and now they're going to  suffer the consequences for it still  only about a 500 gold lead for C9 so not  like they lost massive minion waves or  anything off of that but energy now also  has the push mounting up again you can  see all of these minions piling up here  it'll be another big wave crashing into  the bot side turret top side is uder  being uder as you might expect tough to  Lane against him very very strong been  kind of the Premier go-to pick that  there's not really great answers into so  far nice Wombo Combo back in the mid  lane here JoJo tries to get away but  Pala Fox is ready to knock him down  blabber seea maybe there's an angle try  to get one back on Al Fox throws out the  W doesn't find a ton just a little under  contract but the burst power of Sani not  usually that scary blers coming in but  palifox barely gets away contrax and  palifox really see it how far they can  push this one blabber ends up forcing  the flash of the energy mid lane this  game's extremely high  action blabber is not done yet either he  wants to steal away the chickens  contract knows he's there but he's only  got 200 hp as the vi man he can't go  contest yeah blabber is a pretty beefy  pick here he got both of the early kills  who he wants to get something back  though going for the Abyssal dive but  blabber can just jump out of the way  Arctic Assault clears the distance so  nothing more to punish or catch here for  energy yeah but blabber getting two of  the early kills off the tower dive to  the early bomy Cinder means that he's  able to bully in get a little bit of  counter jungle back since contrax had  stolen away his kugs uh preemptively  before that fight even turned out maybe  this means they just used this priority  to start up the dragon blabber's going  to leash it out right now while Vulcan  and Berserker push up on this bottom  wave and they have JoJo pushing in mid  lane too so free dragon it's very  important for energy to get start  stacking the grubs as early as they can  this game because they have the U Top  should use that to their advantage so  You' just rather see grub pry over early  Drakes anything like that for energy  well for energy side yeah I think so get  that split pushing going a little bit  more value a little bit  easier now you can see a ward inside  that grub pit though placed down by C9  as they take the Drake so they can at  least be wary If energy is trying to do  those cross trades palifox level here on  Thea I always want to see firsta  ultimates result in some kind of a big  movement here it's similar to something  like a knockturn where it's long cool  down but you have so much presence from  somewhere else I want to see him affect  the other lanes with it JoJo with the  push right now Fox still looking since  JoJo had to use his uh Flash the last  time they got the kill on him too as  soon as contrax gets the level six I  think it's going to be a repeat contract  skank in mid lane no flash on the azir  ultimate into seismic shove look for the  kill combo again contracts if he's able  to get the grubs those things do give a  lot of experience this Grub's going to  be hard  La blabber having the edge with that  level six is a big difference maker but  he's just happy to start off with the  chicken Camp right now contract secures  the first grub moving on to number two  these are not going down exceptionally  quickly yeah but ud's got so much pry on  top side uh constantly pushing here is  able to make sure blabber will secure  the grubs for energy so on Turtles  checklist for energy okay nice they've  uh they've corrected the game from the  early dive should be able to get all  three oh they see s here yep oh going to  go all out fud just going to bring go  into a 2V1 before contracts can even  make it over I feel like man you can  never ever forget about where Cante is  in respect to the terrain or you're  going to end up in a spot like  that beautiful St there able to bring  him back into his own pocket next to his  jungler but here's the repeat gank uh  towards mid lane JoJo slides into Tower  no problem for him yeah he's not worried  about that one even even with the thumbs  up that's the yeah the gang's not going  to do anything okay see you later I'll  blow the E cool down c9's in a pretty  Prime position  now what do you want to see him do from  here they just need to maintain and make  sure Zer can push waves safely while he  has no flash right now all right so they  had a poll in chat who's going to bounce  back back from Super week cuz both these  teams had a little bit of a rough super  week Cloud9 obviously more of a rough  one but chat sided very slim margins for  energy okay if you're looking at it  right now Turtle which side are you on  game's still pretty  close I'm still on energy side I feel  like they still have the uh the strong  VI to Lea combo I just want to see it  happen well blabber right now just  making sure that he maintains presence  in the jungle trying to put down a  couple of control Wards just trying to  keep keep an eye on where this enemy  jungler is going to be stop contracts  from finding those ganks finding that  point and click guaranteed engage as  Dola goes to proxy yep UD doing UD  things he's got two turret plates  already on the top side of the map you  mentioned the grubs the extra pushing  power there extra gold value help out  with the splitting later on too but  Vulcan now out onto the map not quite  level six here yet for The Bard very  very close to get his ultimate for some  playmaking ah close doesn't count he's  immediately got to retreat as energy  sends in more men now JoJo retreating  back underneath the turret seismic shove  just barely not going to find him there  could have been in some serious danger  if it did but JoJo staying safe enough  for now the flash just about ready to go  again I believe does have the alul ready  to cast two as Vulcan is trying to again  rotate around be able to be there stop  any kind of play they're making but do  it carefully enough that he doesn't get  caught himself in the process contracts  on top of a control Ward just waiting to  see if C9 tries to force something he  can turn it around yeah everybody in the  game knows they got eyeballs for Jojo  flashes back up now for the azir though  so it makes it even scarier cont is in  trouble yeah contracts getting caught  there try to use the B breaker now turns  it right back around onto JoJo air but  the flash out of the way of the SI MC  shove means contracts is done C the  first kill as Vulcan gos the  timing yeah that part wasn't great but  the part before it was good for C9 yeah  we had timing misses on both sides cuz  po Fox was not ready to follow up on the  contract's ultimate so he didn't get the  seismic shove out of it either so there  was no counter kill for energy another  big one here for Cloud9 right that was  very well played by C9 they just had  everyone around mid cuz they knew that  that the action was going to be there  now energy will try to at least get  something back here on the bottom side  grab the turret plates both TPS used to  bring the midlaners back into their Lane  after the scuffle a single kill on both  of them only a couple of difference in  CS but one of the biggest differences  right now the nashor's tooth First full  item Spike completed for Jojo because  palifox stopped to grab the sorcerer  shoes instead of fully investing into  the one completed item so JoJo feeling  pretty strong right now but again  without that Flash without an ulti he's  got to be careful cuz V could always be  around energy bringing up extra players  as Vulcan goes on a magical journey  trying to get away where is energy going  to go who do they decide to chase  vulcan's your target for now Abyssal  dive coming in to throw him up energy  knocks him down palifox gets paid and  contract starts up the Drake honestly I  it looked a little bit like energy were  also having the same debate that you  were having while you're casting that  flowers like which one are they going to  where are they going to go well pal Fox  flashed uh towards JoJo but then they  end up getting the kill onto Vulcan  anyways so they do get the dragon they  don't get the chase down onto JoJo but  doas right back out onto the map and we  see blabbers currently on the mini map  on the grubs trying to make sure that  energy at the very least will not get  six and he wants to make sure that they  don't get five for the extra void mites  he doesn't have Smite though he used his  Smite on the first one I believe yeah  this could be a problem okay going to  get five here yeah it's four grubs  they're going to try to guarantee the  blabber can't steal away the last one a  TP is coming in energy might just have  to abandon it here JoJo gets stopped by  the unraveled Earth contracts and the  rest of energy cannot secure the fifth  grub C9 critically preventing the break  point preventing the void mites from  spawning as energy does not want to take  the fight any  further definitely like this play too  right afterwards they just teleport Dola  down to the bottom side but Cloud9 like  you said they stopped the critical five  grub point for that really annoying udar  split push slow it down a tiny bit uh  looks like doo is actually not going to  go for the turret plate on the bottom  side he just teleported down there just  to clear out one wave and get his reset  off to Backside here for fudge honestly  this the as the later the game goes it's  going to be really interesting watching  can JoJo actually  work through this kind of beefy front  line or is the vi plus TOA plus Senna  ultimate over the top combo going to be  enough to assassinate him basically  through all of this peel that they have  I think it would be much easier for C9  to play if they actually first engage  with the Sani and The Bard just so they  can navigate the fight easily cuz I  think if VI Lea goes first it's going to  be pretty hard for Jojo yeah definitely  very scary especially with the extra  damage of a senate ultimate coming over  the top yeah that 100% to zero always  always looks scary when when he's got a  Flash and blabber's definitely super  tanky right now on the Sani really  beefed up so him leading the charge  maybe if Vulcan is able to get one of  those big b ultimates to make it easy to  land the  followup could have some 3v3 action  breaking out here FBI and whoi want to  step up at least try to challenge  blabber they're going to steal away the  gro but at what cost whoi popping the  thick skin trying to get away in time as  JoJo's entrance is going to be blocked  off by Pala Fox but blabber has already  killed support who he's down and FBI  about to get knocked out Berserker takes  the kill and c9's up 7 to3 honestly I  feel like energy are their own worst  enemies the the biggest Cloud9 plays  feels like the defending on the tower  dive on bottom and then defending jungle  again here another big one for  Cloud9 honestly energy just needs to  calm it down a little bit around this  bottom Lane Turtle talk to me a little  bit about this situation as somebody  who's played in a professional game like  this you try to make a couple of plays  they end up backfiring how do you sort  of like reset and get yourself back in a  mind state to stop those sort of sort of  mistakes from continuing I think they  just have to take a deep breath and  recognize their win condition they  really need to get toia and VI involved  in these plays and I don't think they  are right now cont tracks well V's  getting involved in a play but is it the  play he wants JoJo's getting locked down  here with a star beautifully done  contracts palifox and FBI have already  found the enemy mid laner but can they  get anymore flabber with a flashback  away try to get underneath the tier one  turret as P Fox tries to cut him off  here with the Weaver's wall FBI needs a  couple more shots but who he's tongue  ain't going to find the mark shut down  back over to Senna still as Berserker  fully Retreats and Vulcan is left to the  graveyard contracts and FBI both coming  right back around piercing Darkness  finds him and tof fox goes on the  Rampage energy get three action packed I  love watching Energy play cuz even after  they fail on the first invade bottom  side then they get right back to it  another fight another Victory and  they're able to swing the gold lead  right back in their favor Cloud9 with  the teleport top for Jojo means that  they should be able to at least get a  tower in the aftermath though okay so C9  will pick this up we talk about  sometimes as gold leads being pendulums  that swing back and forth this one feels  like a yo-yo we're just throwing that  thing out and back and out and back this  game is pretty wild with 13 kills at 16  minutes still under 1,000 gold  separating the two teams you can see on  this gra here the greatest distance that  it was was 1674 in the favor of C9  before that thre Man play that happened  at the hands of energy in the bottom  Lane we do have the heral alive on the  map it's going to be there for another 3  minutes or so still and I don't think  we're going to just see it expire this  game Cloud9 putting a lot of players in  the topside  River all right I don't think it's going  to stop anytime soon flowers cuz we got  a dragon coming up and energy grabbing  the Scuttle crab Vision First they've  got plenty of wards here looking out for  the Cloud9 members coming to try and  check too nice job there popping the  blast cone got the ghost too yeah fudge  has to walk away from that one remember  that fudge is entirely Mr right now  first item is just a kanic Rooker yes he  has tabies but that's not worth a ton on  its own as blabber and the rest of C9  they see at least two players from the  enemy team in the bottom River they're  going to use the opportunities to secure  this heral for themselves while Energy's  got three guys working on the Drake they  should be able to grab that so a cross  map trade in the object jectives c9's  going to look to try to grab some value  here from the eye of the  heral honestly them opting for Rift tril  and trying to get uh through that some  of this outer Tower gold here for either  the azir or the Varys and and just  buffing up these DPS Champs the two  carry uh comp from Cloud9 with both of  them being Auto attack based here I feel  like this is definitely setting  themselves up for the path to victory  for Cloud9 they just have to be able to  execute on this team fight and actually  keep those two carries alive when Jojo  and Berserker have flash it is  definitely playable for Cloud9 when they  do not have flash the energy dive is so  scary though that that combo with by  guaranteeing the setup for POW Fox one  of those two carries is definitely going  to get  annihilated I think for Vulcan he just  has to look out for his ulti onto the um  Tia when by Altis his air so you block  the Tia stop the follow up stop the  combo and then azir's ready to fire back  everybody else works together and kills  by once she Dives in C9 staying together  staying grouped up they have to have  recognized how energy is trending  towards mistakes in this game if you're  grouped up if you can punish those  energy can just gift you the game but  energy with four kills on Pala Fox all  my eyes are on this Tia to see if he can  get the carry done to see if he can step  up and continue making the types of  plays that can deliver them the Dub here  against Cloud9 get revenge for that  first game of the split last month  energy with control over the mid lane  going to push things up here FBI  continuing to harvest those Souls desna  up to 76 18 and a half minutes into the  game as energy controls the bottom side  River yeah honestly they're just  cleaning out more territory where they  can look for picks they've got a lot of  options here with uh with the Tia ult  ready for po Fox to cut people off but  Cloud9 doing their Duty here grouping up  again in mid lane using that Rift Trail  trying to get this outer Tower money  like we're looking for there we go okay  summoned up going for it turret's  already down but now where's the fight  going to go contracts here at the very  front he's going to be Gob by who he to  stay alive DOA wanted an angle he wanted  a pins or attack but the suis summoned  up to make sure that C9 had a banner to  Rally around Dola doesn't have an  entrance into the fight energy still  trying to just regain control over the  mid lane on their side of the map the  sunis slowly Bleeding Out FBI and pal  fox trying to keep fudge away as he  steps forward to establish some vision  control for down in the brush next to  the Raptors but the chickens are being  led on a long journey away from their  home okay they're finally going to reset  and the vision gets cleared yeah both  blabber and fudge are really good for  face checking right now uh trying to get  into enemy jungle push their their  territory forward but that's basically  the expected value of the objective  trade that they saw earlier you know  when you go for that Rift Trail You're  Expecting that's going to be your mid  turret basically guaranteed with that  one Cloud9 do a good job defending their  carries um staying strong here in the  five person setup c9's in a really solid  position right now for this game I think  they're just waiting on berserker's  second item and they should be good to  start baring as  well blade of the ruin King already done  for him as long as he's protected well  enough to get those Auto attacks off  this guy's going to hurt a lot but I'm  curious if energy again maybe if you  can't find JoJo with that VI toia combo  you just turn it on Berserker blow him  up instead vulcan's really going to need  to be paying attention here with this  Bard like you already talked about about  Turtle as soon as you see VI going in  you got to stop the  followup defensive B ulti is going to be  key also worth noting JoJo is going for  the Lich Bane second here cuz he's got  the early Sheen nice little price  reduction on the component item this  patch as well 100 gold off of Sheen um  really really just uh efficient  component now with the ability haste and  the proc that it's going to give you but  it does mean he's not going to have the  LeAndre for the team fight so isn't  going to have the LeAndre for the Tom  kench the vi or the udar but he does  have really good burst damage uh  especially with that auto attack coming  out so quickly now with the new Lich  Bane I do believe the lichbane had the  base ad ratio nerfed on it a little bit  with this patch to just knocked down  ever so slightly yep from 100 down to 75  for a lot of Mage Champions it's not  super impactful just because most of  it's coming from your AP ratio anyway  but still something to be cognizant of  as the gold is tied dead even between  these two teams the Drake is spawning in  a little bit over 30 seconds and they  made the call for po Fox to push out top  side First Energy again trying to play  the map here look at the mini map  they've got bot and top both pushing for  themselves Dragon coming up shortly here  so they've got their side waves correct  they also have the teleport and the ulti  ready for  palifox maybe they can get that top  Tower before Dragon spawns but Cloud9  stays strong you mentioned it multiple  times but sticking as five with those  defensive ultis ready trying to stand  strong and keep Berserker and JoJo safe  seems like energy feels weaker right now  so they're just going to give this  Dragon they don't even want to fight it  exactly they're just going to surrender  it C9 will grab their second Drake of  the game you can see the Crypt Bloom  completed here for palifox he went ahead  Got The Verdant barrier second which I  really liked I think the value of the  spell shield was pretty high against the  composition drafted by C9 but then  recognizing hey they have two massive  meatballs one of which just rushed kanik  Rooker he needs to be able to penetrate  through that magic resistance as Do's  going to see if there's an  anglex could join okay oo I think energy  has to look for good picks on the side  Lanes now let's see it Energy's coming  in JoJo trying to get away contracts  looking for the chance to go in flashes  in for the Alti over the top comes Senna  but JoJo gets out seismic shove ain't  going to find him and energy could not  get the combo executed correctly C9 gets  their mid laner away small little  Windows there in between the timing K  Fox get here now yeah they're just going  to start it up C9 going for this  recognizing hey that was a lot of  resources that's sen ult that's TOA ult  that's VI that's a lot from the tank of  energy and C9 is burning the baron down  they've already got it below 6K below 5K  down to 4K do coming in trying to stop  him but C9 wants to burn it blabber  secures the barar and as fudge tries to  dive into the middle of everybody and  contracts is controlled JoJo's barely  getting away aist will dive on the four  fud is stuck back in the pin as do tries  to tear him up and FBI's grab it a shut  down energy need to find more BL with a  flash out trying to get himself back to  the base while still wearing the purple  he throws out the W but he gets slowed  down by the Tongue FBI still trying to  pursue him still trying to get all the  way there but blabber escapes underneath  the turret it is Baron over to C9 but at  the cost of a two for one trade oh  no into a pause such a good uh call here  from Cloud9 though as soon as there's no  VI ultimate and even though JoJo traded  his flash for contract's Flash they know  they have so much Barren burning power  with azir plus the two item Varys with  the buffed up by the way rageblade now  on Varys melting right through that  Baron so they did get it just in time  even though energy get there and get a  two for one trade just getting plus one  in kills Cloud9 will be very happy  because they also kept three Baron Buffs  to push afterwards  with what a game man this one's turning  into quite the Banger compared to like I  said the first time these two teams  played this split it didn't feel  particularly close it didn't feel like  it was could have gone either way but  this one is 24 minutes in two Drakes  each neither side having enough grubs to  spawn the void mites kills are tied gold  right next to each other it could still  go either way so easy it definitely  could I got an update the pauses for  Berserker he had some issue with his  keyboard another peripheral pause  flowers I'm uh I'm not too H not too  happy with these keyboard issues maybe  we need to we need to inspect them  ourselves  keyboards Turtle has never paused for a  keyboard issue I don't think I have  actually yeah look at this guy you're  one of the longest standing players we  got a pagota pause going on yeah we got  can we get some of those up here yeah  maybe that's the trick we bring  up oh oh man all right well hopefully  we'll be able to get back in here soon  whatever is wrong with yeah they just  really burned the Nash they had the Zer  and then the Varys with the two  core uh honestly from from the energy  side now it it does feel like it's  starting to get a bit difficult because  Cloud9 keep defending the these attempts  at JoJo's life um Berserker doesn't have  ghost he does have flash maybe they go  for the kill onto the onto the vars okay  we're going to get a replay of the last  flight okay okay  yay all right so they're burning down  really good  DPS contract is pretty far so there's no  hope of a steal but contracts look at  him charging his VQ and he goes straight  for the play again onto um JoJo pow Fox  set him up it was a beautiful Tia combo  actually into viq so is pow Fox doing  the work getting JoJo into range and  that's that's the only reason that they  even got the two kills yeah who he just  landed a fourman W yeah the the Abyssal  dive onto four there was crazy cuz if he  doesn't go over the wall I'm pretty sure  that contracts can't hit JoJo again and  JoJo just walks away with 150 HP still  remaining so really nicely done to save  that here you kind of seeing it going  down live the over the shoulder cam from  JoJo yeah now we're looking at a case  where it does start to get really  difficult um for energy here considering  how much gold Cloud9 have gotten on  their air on their Varys pow Fox though  is still really fed to Leah uh and he  does have nine Stacks dark seal you  mentioned that he just finishes CIT  Bloom and he should be able to finish  you know a banshees Veil next or  something unless he was just wants to  sit on the vernant barrier since they  did buff that component as well but  maybe maybe it's a like upgrade to Medi  angle yeah and really go for it I mean  if you fully stack your dark seel and  it's 10 Stacks the the value of  upgrading into Medi is so  big but then I mean if you upgrade it  and you immediately don't die lose all  10 pages where' your value go where'  your value go okay I can I can respect  it though if you feel like okay the game  starting to we got win we got to make  big plays I'm the only one who can do it  sure maybe but then again you're going  to get flamed if you die if you lose the  pages Let's see we don't have uh don't  have any additional updates right now we  do I'm curious the same way that you are  Kobe is he going to just go ahead and  complete the Banshees Veil or also do  you just hit something you know Magi  death cap whatever just something turbo  damage focused to try to guarantee that  you get that instant burst cuz the  biggest issue for me throughout this  game for energy has just been the  coordination hasn't felt right whether  it was the early dive where okay  contracts is going back in but it looked  like we probably should have all just  walked away are all committed when they  tried to make the pick on jojo in the  jungle but he just barely gets out even  back in mid lane when there's there's  that slight delay on the follow-up of  the contract salty there's just a little  bit that's not quite there for energy  this game all I got an update we're  we're rushing a new keyboard over now  okay emergency substitute keyboard David  has the keyboard chat send your energy  to David running it over as quickly as  possible now yeah we're back into the  game that was really fast they must have  sent a lot of energy yeah that was a  bunch okay we're back into the game now  24 minutes in slight gold lead for  energy but you would expect that to  swing back into the favor of C9 since  like you pointed out Kobe they still  have the baron on multiple  players okay got to refocus after the  pause that was the biggest thing even  blabber himself was talking about last  time when Cloud n had the big pause he  lost Focus we'll see if uh honestly it's  not too bad if a saidani this fed  actually loses Focus he's so tanky and  he's got the Regeneration from his  warmog so Cloud9 have the ability with  Baron buff to push up multiple Lanes and  they have really good face Checkers here  in blabber and fudge they're going to  push out mid and then rotate basically  everybody over yeah having The Bard  makes it so much nicer for your side a  lot uh a lot more options here with  those tunnels General observation about  the map state to hold on tp's coming in  energy having a disengage now as blabber  misses the Sani Al chains of corruption  also missed C9 saw what looked like  maybe an angle but they cannot execute  successfully so energy just walks off  from that one worth pointing out c9's  got this Baron buff for a little bit  over another minute once it expires  it'll be about 60 seconds from then  until the Drake so C9 does have the  opportunity to set up the rift for an  advantageous position remember with both  teams already at two Dres a piece the  next one's going to be sole point for  someone who he jumps in the abys will  die but nobody else is close enough to  do a lot especially not with fudge being  the only one here on the front line even  though cloud n uh you know missed the  Sani Al from good a Maneuvers from whoi  and then he flashes the bar Cloud9 still  get an isolated outer turret for Jojo  for this azir that is working on death  cap which scals so well considering you  added the lichbane with another AP ratio  onto him so JoJo approaching Three core  for Jojo and for Berserker energy  they've got to start feeling the  pressure here they're they they might  start feeling a little desperate we  might see another one of these super  deep aggro plays from them contract has  flash po fox has  flash they they really need to make good  on one of those picks and try and get  someone from Cloud9 isolated get some of  those key Summoner spells off of the  Cloud9 carries cuz if those two are are  just safe the air and the Varys right  now will demolish you well Baron has  faded gentlemen it is 60 seconds until  the Drake spawns we don't really see a  whole lot happening in that botside  river right now there is is currently  energy Vision controlling it but a  couple of Cloud9 Wards on the back side  of the pit to also see if energy is  trying to make more of an entry into  that part of the ra part of the rift  excuse me right now as C9 is more  focused on the top side they've got all  five players either in mid or in that  topside River area as JoJo is set up to  push Top Lane they seem really content  with farming right now on the air yeah  look at this H how nice is it to have  two people shadowing blabber and Vulcan  the two babysitters to come watch JoJo  Farm on the Sid Lanes they're like  please just eat up a little bit more  money here I'm surprised they didn't  want oh he's going he's going for zonas  instead of the death cap here it's  pretty smart versus the vi I think yeah  it's their only win condition he got the  Seeker so he has an active already for a  stopwatch to deny that Cloud9 play  really smart or deny that energy play  Cloud9 really smart fight might break  out here yeah we got energy on the  approach a t P coming into the mid lane  from palifox who he's going to be caught  by the B Al but he's the only Target now  he's got to try to tank it up S Al over  the top who he's still about half HP  fudge coming in looking to complete the  dive as Berserker goes on the Rampage go  is thrown back into the team all out  goes fudge all in goes contract but he's  one5 he ain't alive everybody died it's  SE nine three for nothing there you go  right into their hands they have scaled  Cloud n  protect and they collect  Dragon number three that was good yeah  that was smooth that was slick yeah I'm  pretty sure once the Varys also gets a  stopwatch this game should be over yeah  really good immediately immediately used  the seeker's arm guard right after  purchasing but honestly they already had  the advantage in the team fight here you  know where they're getting so much free  damage on is just too far he TP to the  mid Tower he just wasn't close enough  for this fight yeah so they get a really  big head start in the health bars here  lots of free damage onto that energy  front front line and then uh yeah it was  all lost this game is looking really  hard for energy  now Cloud n currently in the process of  bouncing back from their super weak  losses here they have been able to stay  strong zero death here yeah yeah I mean  hey I was saying I wanted to see  Berserker and Vulcan also not have the  same kind of mistakes that they had last  week Berserker is currently 40 and four  on the Varys blabber in all the losses  that C9 had for super Wick a lot of  people were complaining he didn't have  the same level of presence and pressure  that you would normally expect from him  31 and seven here on the Sani only one  kill that he hasn't been a part of here  for this team let's see if this engage  works out in mid lane as who he turned  into a golden statue once again they're  going to put the burst into the Tom  kench and JoJo sits him down C9 have  picked up one and the baron is alive on  the rift now energy are once again  tasked with trying to stop it they now  know how fast C9 is at taking this blade  of the ruin King Varys plus the azir  this this is so difficult for energy to  stop but they're making the approach C9  already have it down to below half HP  down to about 1/3 now Doan contracts  they just know they can't approach all  this is going to be is a team fight loss  on top of a bear and if they go in for  it C9 still chasing seeing if maybe they  can pick one up at the back end of  things set up for the disengage fudge  goes over the wall Q3 won't hit anybody  magical journey don't matter pathmaker  gets him out all right no kills on the  back but C9 is happy to turn a pick into  a bear and never mind we done yet  contract's going to be caught here with  the top C trying to reinforce him keep  protected but fud does a lot of damage  contract still alive as JoJo gets a way  into the back palifox wants to Chase and  JoJo's On The Run palifox goes in but  JoJo shovel him right back palifox  denied energy died and C9 is loving the  way this mid game's been going do is  treding to get away but no sir fudge  knocks him down and berserker's ending  the game the whole time berserker's just  over here violating Towers that's the  ADC dream right there he's inside the  base s the rest of Cloud9 and they're  going for it Cloud n had a rough week  last time around but they're ready to  stop that here who he is not going to  stop anything on his own the C9 lost  streak will grind to a halt as they  defeat energy again 16  to8 JoJo that game really just cracked  open yeah yeah they were able to scale  they were able to play it safe here I  was really yeah the coordination from  energy was just off I feel like this  game mhm energy Kobe you said it best  back at the start energy was just giving  him stuff Cloud9 playing well but  playing reactively not having that  pressure on him to have to make things  happen cuz Energy's just like all right  we're yoloing it go go go botling PVP  PVP and it didn't work out for them  energy is going to have to really work  on the the coordination if they want to  play that crazy play that out of pocket  but for C9 you got to be breathing a  little bit of a sigh relief you get rid  of all of that losing streak that bad  mental and you're finally back feeling  like okay we can execute a little bit  Yeah they went with a with a safe style  here to get that safe first win and  they're going to go crazy tomorrow I  mean hey man it worked out you guys were  talking about having the front line  having the two damage the two threat  damage comp and it worked out the Tia  the vibe both getting shut down by the  time you have that Zia's hourglass video  go on the azir good stuff coming out  from C9 and a reminder to all y'all  fantasy LCS is happening on sleeper it's  not too late to sign up and start a  league with your friends and Crush their  dreams with your own LCS super team  super teams we've seen them go good  we've seen them go bad how about yours  we're going to see you can head on over  to sleep.com or st. apppp to give it a  try right now that is our first game of  the day all wrapped up and so it's time  to join Emily and JoJo on stage for an  interview Hello I'm here with the  Victorious JoJo Pion after C9 kind of  stopped their losing streaks so first of  all congratulations thank you I mean it  feels kind of weird winning I'm not used  to this right now but there's a good  feeling uh I know in an interview uh  just this past week you actually talked  to Ashley Kong about how losing makes  things more interesting uh do you have  any comments on that after your first  win in a little while I mean I think a  lot of people including me were  expecting like C9 to kind of just [ __ ]  on everyone this whole split um but I  think now that I think about it if we  realize our mistakes right now and we  improve I think that's much better so I  don't think the losses were too bad on  how we reflected on it so yeah and going  into this week uh what was your  preparation like like in draft or I mean  we tried playing a bunch of new  Champions cuz I  think our tramps were kind of obvious of  what we're going to week so I think  we're trying to expand our chample a lot  more so yeah uh when you look at draft  just because it's something that a lot  of the community has pointed out I have  also pointed out and been critical at  times um when you're looking at drafting  for this team I think one thing that  people are curious about in is balancing  the strength of you all as individual  players which is quite high with the  actual coordination of composition so  how much thought goes into that I mean  definitely a lot of thought goes into  that cuz every single player on this  team can carry right so I mean I feel  like that's really good we can make  draft really versatile so that's what  we're trying to do right now um since  every player can carry so yeah nice I  will still defend the VIN mid actually I  mean I thought V mid was good if I had  more practice I definitely could have  carried but it happened nice we'll look  forward to it again in the future maybe  um going forward uh looking out at kind  of how the C9 team is doing obviously  you get the win today uh how are you  guys going to build on this win towards  the  future I mean it's definitely a good  confidence boost that we won today I  think if we lost today it definitely  went out big good so um I think we're  getting our confidence back so yeah all  right well all the best thank you so  much for taking the time to talk to me  and we'll see you guys back on the other  side of the break thank  [Applause]  you  get his back nice we're back this feels  weird what the  I'm used to this hey guys it's hero from  moral Progressive today me and my  teammates are going to be answering  questions from this bowl what type of  books do you like to read I don't even  know cuz I don't read books what are you  most excited about for the future uh me  I will be rich  guy wa that's okay your heart your brain  or your God my brain I'm so smart what's  on the top of your bucket list you know  winning LCS top of my bucket list I was  one game away with tactical 2021 we lost  2 three very disappointing we were all  sub to one dude why'd you put your new  rig in the basement didn't you hear  Bill's a good gillionaire now basically  my new connection is so strong I can  game anywhere check it out we've got  gamer rocker gamer floaty gamer couch  wow it's got wheels gamer bench gamer  throne and gamer  mower what's that it's hard to gamble  walking downstairs I get it that's smart  live like a gillionaire with low latency  everywhere AT&T fiber with Ali  [Applause]  Red Bull gives you  [Music]  wings  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  to those attending today from the  legends of Runa Invitational I think I  think I saw their sign earlier I don't  approve but  welcome Legends rou are greater than  League of Legends a different sign  someone said L greater than either way  we're into Immortals versus Dinger TOS I  think Immortals uh surprising three and  four uh I keep asking if they're good I  rewatched some of the games I think they  are definitely good actually so curious  to see if they can keep up the momentum  against the today yeah I'm curious to  see if Ole keeps picking the highest win  rate supports true Elise was on there he  did not pick it that's not going happen  kind of sad about that you know the hen  special um as we see uh kalista ory  getting banned out by dig and then the  vi and Senna getting B out by maai is  still terrorizing people in soloq I'll  put that out there right now as you can  see in the win rates out there himer is  very doable that seems like a sample  size problem for 60% on we're going to  see the himer oh my goodness I think Mal  maai B I think oh it says Masters plus  yes that's that's always going to be an  minimum 100 games it's like oh yeah he's  6 one and 40 yeah turto what would you  do if your support just turns to you and  they're like I'm picking based on win  rate and that something really weird i'  be extremely open to all of them  actually I do believe the stats so  highest win rate supports sign me up I  actually love that one of the signs pick  allawi you cowards as we're in a rich  game so this guy picked allawi before  the bus came through nice now I mean I I  would be extremely excited to see all uh  on the side of dignitas I I know we've  been talking about them a fair bit being  like an exciting two and five or like  it's nice when the last place team is  this exciting and we have some go graphs  from their previous games and I think it  does speak to how many games they've  actually had leads in you can see three  of those eventual losses one to 100  thieves one to team liqu and one to fly  Quest they had gold leads in the game  after the 20 minute Mark so they're  actually a fairly solid early game team  but they've just been unable to actually  kill the Nexus yeah one thing I really  appreciate as we see the smoulder hover  is it going to go through for dig we  actually did highlight dig as one of  those teams that might be willing to  throw out some picks to try to move  themselves up in the standings we have  our first smolder lock in and we  actually will not know where it's going  until later because like I said uh NAC  was on this patch yesterday and we saw  this champion in both the mid and the  bot Lane yeah and I will say Tomo is the  biggest smolder appreciator in world so  even when he was not available in the  last week's games he was still playing  the pick so I feel like he's the most  studed up on the champion so even if it  is a a decent Flex pick I fully expect  it to go over to Tomo I kind of think if  Castle's not careful with his pick it's  going to go tall oh Rich Quinn smolder  what's the  difference both any carries right Rich's  eyes are wide  open let's go all right so for IMT we  have the Zer lock in we also I do want  to call out the um Ivor turn for Aro  that's one of his uh Stronger Champions  we've seen him have success on that  against C9 and also tactical with uh Zer  even though he's on a three and four  team leads the LCS in kills you can see  Tomo fourth place in kills as well so  this is one of the reasons I think the  bottom of the standing seems so exciting  is these teams that haven't necessarily  won all the games are actually leading  the league in kills which is super not  normal yeah and I think it made sense to  everybody going in from the off season  cuz at least for IMT say like they had a  clear identity that they wanted to play  through mid and wanted to play through  bot Lane and it makes sense Olay is a  trigger happy support if he gets a hand  on Thresh Nautilus or anything like that  he's going to be calling for help in the  bot side of the map but we know how Lane  focused tactical is as a player so it  makes a lot of sense and I feel like  their winds have come off the back of it  this is a really exciting G so far  actually I just love the fact that we're  seeing the buffed up Zer it has hyper  carryer potential because of our Mayo's  Iver and we have this smolder mystery  not only is it going to be the first  smolder in the LCS we still don't know  where it's going to go you can't okay  smolder in atro would be trash I  think what into atrox would be garbage  yeah I I don't garage it's it's to I'm  pretty sure it's going to be bottom it's  too what is the uh so talk to us a  little bit about the zeri smolder  matchup so the zeri smolder matchup is  uh I think it's favor to Zer like past  like level level six I think like pre  six like small D just has is full  advantage smolder can just keep pushing  the wave and poking Zer down but I think  at level six um Zer can just look for  all all in timers and a question that I  have is like what support do you usually  want to pair up with a smolder in  general um that's actually a tricky  question I've seen teams play um  enchanters and heart supports or heart  engag supports yeah  um I I feel like the millio might  actually be a good pairing with smolder  just to increase the range that makes  sense to me I think he's going to have  have a tough time dealing with Iver just  in general having to dip in and out of  his bushes so that's a question that I  would have but you could just get like a  hard engage support too I guess like the  Recon and just set up the Alti you know  yeah if they lock this in well would  Flex to Jungle and we know their Lane  that also gives Ole the counter pick  potential but yeah oh play man he can't  cuz uh dig banned out uh dig got rid of  both the  and I assume the well not I assume we  know the maai fan is going up against uh  Ole and not Aro who's already locked in  Iver way support or midy way support is  not the win rate King let me tell you so  we'll see I saw Barrel do really well in  one series I don't know what Ole would  pick here knowing Ole though he might  just pick like barter or  something locked in I mean it could be  ol on way support but we'll obviously  know with this last pick yeah I think  any form of engage here would be nice  Leona was something that was coming up  to mind just because you're going up  against the raon so pretty clearcut way  of engaging into dignas comp I just feel  like Lon is not a very good Champion  right  now why is that we'll see though I I  just feel like she dies very easily when  she goes in she's just committed it's  kind of easy to just beat  up a lot of engage on the side of dig  let's see what they end up locking here  this is yeah this is super interesting I  mean I'm going to hold to say this is  still a flex but it's it's actually  could be yon Top Lane into the atrox if  they want to end up going so this is a  really Dynamic comp from dignitas  actually this is really exciting Real's  going to probably be their I guess they  have con yeah jungler sole form of  engage so I'm really loving the comp  that we have here and jat I want you to  ask the question one more time uh what's  the question Raz is is IMT good are they  cuzz even though we're talking about the  draft and that has been the focus for me  it's been the play it's something  different about IMT that we've been  seeing in their recent games and  especially in their wins and for me  mistakes like these that we see from  mask where he ends up making a misplay  when they go up against Cloud9 usually  costs them the game because you know you  make one mistake Barons are going to be  an issue and in this play actually IMT  not only recognized they're going to be  a man down they're sticking around just  they can dissuade from a C9 going for  Baron here but they realize one thing  and one thing clearly C9 is dissipating  UD a is going towards the midlane wave  so they're actually separated so bar  just sends the Alti they find a 4v5 play  being able to pick off JoJo Pion and  they end up winning a fight and imts in  the past usually play extremely scared  don't look for plays like that but this  is a different IMT to me where they make  a mistake initially stick around a  little bit for Baron and they capitalize  on a misplay coming in from C9 and I  think they they can do the same versus  diing toss Raz is a big castle fan  Castle on atrax once again let's head to  the casters get us into the  game ladies and gentlemen welcome back  to the LCS it's Immortals versus  dignitas and it's time for two  simultaneous debuts not only the first  smolder played in the LCS as he just now  became  playable yep it's the first whe in the  LCS as well they're on opposite sides of  the rift one starts out with 100% win  rate the other one's got big fat donut  yeah and smolder of course it actually  was picked in Challengers but this is  the first pick for smolder in any tier  one region um so I'm very excited for  this champ I want to see if we're going  to get the Spear of sojan start for him  because that has really been gaining  popularity you get so much ability haste  that that item is the Premier Source of  ability haste now that they started  removing it from a lot of other sources  um and you are able to stack so insanely  quickly with it I'm really interested to  see it specifically in this game cuz  it's up against Zer I was talking to  shogo who's a multi- region Challenger  player won sew a couple of times asking  him about it cuz he was posting a lot of  screenshots about you know winning with  it in Challenger here's how you play it  and he was talking about how it feels  like it has a similar role to aeria  aiver where it might not command  powerful early Lane pryo but if you get  out of Lane without being behind you're  going to outpace your opponent you're  going to have so much AOE damage so much  scaling potential and considering he's  up against the pentakill Pikachu that  inspired nightmares in players for  multiple multiple months I really want  to see how this head-to-head shakes out  P to kill Pikachu with a fresh shiny  buff flowers yes sir Bas ad up on Zer  ultimate as well here tactical was one  of our original Zer players too if you  remember he had a viral clip but rich is  surrounded yeah he immediately flashes  away the root collar if that would have  hit him there he could have been in some  serious trouble D this is is such a sick  draft from both squads this game is so  fun there's so many things to talk about  because Ivor is one of my favorite  pairings for any jungle Plus ad carry  obviously the one on camera now Quay  first LCS pick has been pretty popular  in the LC honestly but um smolder here  hiding from us flowers who's that  Pokemon what who was behind that brush  who could it be who could possibly be in  there so I do have to I'm just going to  go ahead I'm going to come clean about  something right now before the minions  spawn honesty is the best policy flowers  I have no idea what this dude's  abilities are not even the beginning of  a compreh way right cuz I know you know  I know smolder ability name say them now  say them and you're going to like it  super Scorch your breath auu flap flap  flap and Mom there you go there we've  got all of them my favorite part is the  my my favorite part is the little wiggle  when he screams mom fall out the dragon  it's so funny to watch that ultimate by  the way since it starts behind you  sometimes for Lane phase uh you know  people will cast it backwards so you can  get the quicker uh end of it yeah down  on them but we we'll see there's so many  tips and tricks to go over uh right now  in Lane though mask being our first LCS  Quay this is a champion that um I I have  a lot of confidence in the team fighting  of sometimes you can it can get a little  dicey towards the early stage you know  when people are ganking you and never  mind hold  on a little spicy down here really low  yeah can get can get a little dicey  early on in some skirmishes and ganking  but the champ scal so well cuz you have  just massive AOE and really strong range  So speaking of scaling up I do want to  go ahead and just talk really quickly  about a couple of smolder points cuz I  know a lot of people either haven't  played them maybe they don't play any  carries I didn't bother reading the tool  tips the break points you got to look at  for his stacks and you get a stack for  last hitting with q or damaging an enemy  with any spell  25 gets you your first AOE your farming  is really slow until you hit 25 then 125  gets you the ones that bounce behind and  225 is your imop now level 16 kale type  of moment where you're spewing true  damage onto everybody with a DOT it's  very very strong but that's what we're  going to keep track of is how fast he  can hit that 225 great Point yeah and  you can all keep track at home look at  this nice little Nifty passive tracker  that they have over smolder uh in the  bottom right there currently at 13 now  generally the the aim is to get it by  around you know mid game 20 minutes kind  of average there have been some crazy  ones I was talking with you know the  guys on the dive about it ail was like  he got to 225 at like 17 minutes that's  really fast there are there are some  early ones um of course you know if you  get some really nice bounces you can you  can throw your snot ball through two CHS  at once you got to call it hold on rich  is trying to get away from a gank here  in the Top Lane Aro shows up Castle  should have enough damage to bring him  down here it's First Blood over to the  Iver the burn from Red takes him out  imortal every snotball though on the is  that  wrong it's a tree he don't have snot the  snot is in the oh the dragon is Oh I  thought you were saying Aro hit him with  a snot ball no no no like haven't you  played ivern oh the dragon is the one  with the snot ball that tries to stack  up with it you got to stack your notnot  balls if you want to succeed on small  it's called a che and the big fiery ball  comes out anyway Aro is on the invade  here and did uh did catch him on those  on those Raptors so they got visual  confirmation that he's on the top side  nice quick trading there coming out from  mask as Rich again has to respect has to  be careful he's got the ward there in  the pixel brush that lets him know that  our Mayo is hanging around yes ex there  it is also nearby got a got a stack we  got another stack he only needs two more  and then he has the AOE on the Q which  like I said is going to make it much  easier to really accelerate the pacing  of those Stacks you get all the range  minions low hit one of them with a Q it  blows up all three nothing to it very  fast farming as he has cleared the  threshold Now 26 Stacks 5 minutes into  the game he gets the first evolution all  right smoulder scaling nicely on bottom  side meanwhile pushing mid lane with qu  pretty effortless there Max making good  use of the Mana return Auto attacks  shoving in Dove taking out so much of  his HP uh of the turret plate himself  and does get his first back Castle  dodging away from the Q3 there from Rich  means that they will not have the CC to  lock him down long enough for XU to make  an entrance even with crash down Castle  can just get away from it so XU has to  walk it off now we can actually talk  about some of the regular Champions here  since there are so many things to  discuss as XU will be able to clean up  all of the kugs cuz re is one of the  best or grub taker on the rift but  Mortals if we're examining their draft  then one of the things that goes under  the radar with all of these new picks is  Castle's atro and if we bring up their  previous games here never mind we might  have too much action Tomo just face  checking into the brush there oay  immediately hitting him with the shield  of Daybreak forcing out the cleanse the  flash to follow it Olay is getting the  money and Tomo's down nice Olay Killer  Instinct here in the brush Leona  flashing on him has the ignite death to  the Dragon number one but there's the  castle atro stats very good for  immortals last week was very good to  them and he had couple of those ones  dropped so feels very confident on the  champion I know and Immortals here also  have some really good late game options  not just the lanes but the ivn plus the  zeri for later on Quay really big AOE  damage for a lot of these clumped up  melee Champions that dignitas have  drafted that ultimate that's on display  for you now is going to be one of those  big tools that mask has to counter uh  these grouped up melee champs as  dignitas all but the  dragon um should provide pretty good  damage soaks here for Mass to be able to  dump his spells into and as mass  continues putting points in the  abilities as he levels up and really  maxing out that subject disaster the  Quee for all the damage can clear out  those waves incredibly quickly with that  pseudo Rumble ulti that he can cast  through the molten as is and Tomo just  absorbing some pressure here as our Mayo  makes his appearance known in the bottom  side MK could get ganked by XU as he'll  approach from the control warded brush  and remember last time around when these  two teams did play dignos got the win  mass does get hit Mass getting hit as  the immediate follow up with a flash  from XU they need a little bit more  damage and they'll find it dignitas gets  their first kill of the game and they  get it on Dove yeah that's the worst of  the outcomes possible for Mass to flash  afterwards he does not Flash the chain  and once Dove hits the chain beautiful  followup from xq flashes in with the  rail full combo and then with mask also  flashing after that and still dying very  very big possible momentum here starter  for dignitas asylus getting early kills  is always so so nice o not afraid to  just immediately jump in and fight  against the Recon Leona being one of  those picks that whenever the meta is z  raan defined in the bottom Lane Leona  will eventually show up if enough time  passes without Nerfs because of how  excellent she can play into raon as a  champion but Mas I mean he's got range  he's got power he's got CC but he has no  Mobility whats got Grace he can throw a  puddle on the ground and walk a little  faster through it but now top side it's  Castle under pressure and he's not going  to get very far exu takes him down  dignitas ties the game exu the Highlight  here for dignitas the first one was set  up for him really easily in mid lane by  dub hitting a nice chain uh uh but there  goes back topside gets another gank off  takes down Castle is going to be a  dragon in compensation here for  immortals since the enemy jungler shows  top side but that is some nice money  into rich on a rich style Top Lane  takeover Champion yon truly the  possibilities of the 1 v9 trying to get  that combo the dream scenario into the  backline where he could annihilate the  Zer and the H those really strong late  game carries so we see what Rich can do  because in the last year with digas most  of the stories that we were telling were  about rich Champions and yeah stuff he  was picking in the top side and his  counter picks for Top Lane and the  possibilities of running over the game  there so XU doing a good job setting up  both his solo Lanes so far mask could be  in trouble XU staying right on the very  edge of  vision mask still stepping back up XU is  just going to try to steal away this  chicken Camp he can see that it's primed  with the The Grove from the Iver uhhuh  that always feels so good oh yeah I just  be like oh you wanted to come pick these  up huh uh no you put some work into this  you spend some health and some Mana to  channel on this damn shame yoink all  cast q and their mind well dignitas  still trying to get enough Stacks here  on Tomo that's exactly what I was  talking about right there you get either  all three melees or all three rang low  and then execute them with one super  Scorch your breath together he's up to  65 Stacks remember again the next break  point 125 is going to get the smaller  bouncing projectiles after the first one  that can help you clear entire waves at  once and because ivn is support style  jungler gets to build support items  pretty cheap and got the early Moonstone  there with the classic dark seal uh-oh  Mass getting jumped on here the upscan  the ABD do the immediate crash down to  follow it up but Immortals are keeping  their mid laner alive a massive amount  of AOE the spiraling despair has found  multiple targets dub dies first mass  stays alive Rich misses the Target and  he barely finds the kill in the back end  but now Castle's made his rotation into  the fight here too Aro with a roof  caller and rich is about to drop  Immortals outplay him and slay him baby  they underestimated way and they do not  live to tell the tale the Ivan with the  Moonstone completed empowered Shields  keeping them alive and Aro flashes for  the root collar to make sure they get  two of them let's take another look at  just how much he's able to Shield here  so as he's getting charged in on big  double one comes in then he gets out the  daisy as well and even though they get  charms up look at this massive AOE Mass  kiing back he's able to put out so much  another Shield comes up from Aro they're  able to save him long enough that they  get the two kills and by the time Rich  comes in here with the flash  ultimates he's got no team left and  aro's able to flash follow him rollar to  allow the rest of the team to pick it up  and the grubs will go their way and ha's  passive is designed for fights like that  being able to trigger the ability  explosions on multiple clumped up enemy  Champions that situation ended up great  for immortals they're up 1,000 gold and  a drake so far yeah really really  exactly the type of fight that Immortals  want where Mass gets to tank it up with  multiple ivn Shields giant AOE damage  coming through giving them one of the  neutral objectives as well  afterwards and now they're taking over  jungle here there went the ulti I have  to say the name out loud cuz it wasn't  really used for anything cool get the  ground we're not going to overdo it m  mhm wait for later I'm just waiting for  your big moment I got I got to pick my  moment man I got to pick my moment that  was not the moment Immortals just  continuing to push up here there's that  molten fissure I was talking about like  once you have all the levels in the  queue once you have a little bit of AP  you just kind of blast the wave and go  look for something else to do yeah it's  one of the big difficulties for this  dignitas comp is the jungle has already  been taken over XU gets pushed out but  he got his gromp right now huddle behind  the Tower as that turret plate you know  tactical wants this turret plate so bad  yeah he's so close to it he will get it  before uh the 14-minute mark for sure as  I get to push in afterwards here but  does start to get really hard for dig  because one of the things they're  lacking with this team comp is the wave  clear like we highlighted earlier on  they're fairly short range except for  tomo except for the dragon everybody is  melee there and so you're going to be  you got to come from different angles  and try not to give this way to any nice  setups here um you have a a big problem  if a o AOE comes down from Olay he sets  it up iron slows come down from the  shields popping off of him as well and  and your uh your melees get massively  AOE down but the dragon is a scaling  tommo at 90 now at 13 and a half minutes  into the game so he's on Pace well he's  going to have to make sure he does not  lose that pace as Reaver completed at  his first item too I know you were  thinking about builds so going to go  with that one that guarantees not only  do you get the sheen proc on your Q's  but now they're refunding more Mana than  they cost yeah and if you do go for the  essence Reaver uh start then you're  going to need to go for the navori quick  blades to follow that one up ARO ARO  getting caught here in a 3v2 the burst  from Dove is enough and the shutdown  goes to the dignitas mid laner nice pick  up that brush right there the banana  Brush by the Herold SLG grub SL Baron  pit the void pit there's a lot of people  living in this one apartment now it's  it's a really crowded bit now um  Honestly though getting control Wards  into that brush early on into the game  almost always pays dividends Rich okay  the One V one Castle trying to flash it  out playo but he doesn't Rich does not  have the power of God and Anime on his  side Castle is too strong even with the  blade of the Run King uh finish there  loses the Allin Castle atrox you said it  brings it home again and since they did  get three of the grubs he has a little  bit of extra pushing power with the  damage over time will get a huge reward  Here solo outer Tower in addition to the  solo kill feels good man one one and two  here on this guy up 500 gold over his  opponent took out the turret should be  able to go back to base and acquire that  completed profane Hydra massive power  Spike faor My Favorite that thing is so  juicy big burst damage but here's a look  at it and I think the big part is going  to be the Q3 so there's q1 Castle nice  flash over God he hits all of them yeah  good P he got the passive Auto before  the ult too and then q3's backwards  right on top of him cuz he knows where  yon is going to land that ultimate  coming through and the Q3 is coming down  on your head very well read There by  Castle knowing how to play against those  High Mobility Champions and you can see  the frustration on Rich's face he's like  damn he got me complet completely  outplayed top side overloaded here with  dig nice rotation from them they bring  over the jungle support from mid lane to  allow Dove to get his outer Tower as  well get some more money into this stus  who by the way R of Ages got some nice  Buffs on the patch as well yes sir  little bit of extra HP and mana on that  one for him okay still a very close game  here both games so far today have not  had these runaway early games for either  side as we'll see Immortals pick up  another Drake for themselves dignitas  are not doing super great in the neutral  objective contest here so far but  remember they did get the herald off the  back of their previous pick on Aro we're  still yet to see what they can  accomplish with that this is so fun  we're going to get to test Zer scaling  with an ivern on our team by the way to  buffer up versus the Omega Dragon  scaling and  1640 into the game 128 now here so again  we're still looking every scaling point  is nice but you know you know the big  one you know 225 is what everybody's  looking at here yeah um and especially  once you get your quick blades too don't  underestimate reducing the cool down on  your flap flap flap the kiing ability of  of the smolder sounds is huge for later  because uh the Synergy is there when  you're able to reduce the cool down and  keep it going as we get the charges keep  on going here yeah there it goes big old  charge down the bottom Lane with a bunch  of void mes popping out Castle's ready  to defend though they'll lose about half  HP on that tier two mask is going to  take the tier one of dignitas on the  opposite side of the map at the same  time just letting that turret finish off  as many of the minions as possible while  he hits the wave so there you go game  still just so close between these two  squads we're 2 and A2 minutes away from  Baron spawning on the  rift and we've got smolder still  stacking up he it was 5 minutes for  Evolution 1 1645 you said it for  Evolution 2 and most players want to try  to get this in the low 20s for the 225  you really need that true damage burn to  feel like you're living your best life  as a little baby definitely agree there  um honestly this game I just feel like  ivn is going to do so much work flowers  so much potential here with Redemption  finish second this is this is one of the  uh preferred builds with giant melee  clumps if you get a Redemption huge  value from healing up not only your team  in your front line here trying to hold  the line where you're throwing Shields  into Castle you're throwing the  Redemption down to keep them going uh  make sure that squishier lethality atrox  stays upright but you're going to get  huge value over all these dignitas  members too it just feels like the team  fight of Immortals has so much potential  uh to be able to to to destroy them that  dignitas got to continue to look for  some of these aggressive angles and the  vision these Wards are going to be a  problem for them they've been scouted  they've been seen and Immortals here  moving in yeah but they didn't have the  damage dealers close enough immediately  it was our mayo and oay far up while  mask and tactical were trying to catch  up so dignitas had enough time to  disengage and yeah worth pointing out  even if we take the smallest values  possible from the Redemption it's 200  Health restored to Allied Champions 10%  Max HP true damage to enemies if you got  all 10 dudes in the circle that's a  2,000 HP swing between the damage being  done and the health being healed with  minimum values intense stuff we'll see  how much value our Mayo can get out of  that as the game moves on under 2  minutes until the next Drake is taken  it's another Mountain Rift and it's a  two lead for immortals there do you  think dig tries to stop him from getting  soulle point or do you just say nope we  got to wait on smolder 225 fight him for  soul honestly I really want that smolder  225 okay I feel like that is the win con  here for dignitas it does so much when  you get that extra burn you have the  execute as well uh and dingas like they  they will have a massive engage you know  it's it's going to be explosive they're  either going to win in a big way or  they're going to lose in a big way and I  have had a lot of faith here in exus and  gages already on the ra so maybe they do  find the angle maybe they do get that  dream yon followup you know real plus  yon combinations and raon yeah is has  definitely been been performing so far  this year in the LCS and him with flash  is always deadly o wants to keep trying  to fight these guys contest for the  vision in the top side River Baron is  live on the rift now 20 minutes 30  seconds into the game another 45 or so  to go until that Drake spawns as we can  see couple of resets coming out as  everybody wants to go back get their  Vision complete their items if you know  a team fight's coming up you got to be  ready ahead of time Recall now for tomo  I assume he's probably got the money for  the naori quick blades he goes back and  yep there it is okay two it power Spike  for him two item power Spike for the  silus we already talked about two items  for ivern but he buys he buys cheap  stuff like count the same way two items  for the atrox here as well hey two two  item discounts still two items uh when  they're when they're this impactful it  was kind of nice in the in the offseason  they gave some little Buffs to a lot of  the support items so Iver got to benefit  from that as well as oay here with the  shields trying to fight that Vision  fight or may just spamming them [ __ ]  not afraid to jump over the wall oay  throws out the eclipse there ready to  make sure that he can tank up if the  fight breaks out but dignitas does not  want to full commit to anything here  just yet tactical will try to find  whatever poke he can with the zap as  mask wants to push out the mid lane but  Tomo's happy to answer 200 stack flowers  They're going to fight on the dragon 200  Stacks if Immortals can force a fight  before he hits 225 it could really  change the landscape of things here as  exu is Behind Enemy Lines a TP coming in  from dig to reinforce but the whole crew  is there from immortal Ching after XU  root caller thrown out at the very last  second but XU can get away in time  dignitas grouping back up together here  in the botside river now I got to say it  didn't look like much but that is really  big Immortals Castle specifically going  to try and Mark him and getting that ra  flash blown finding him on the side good  awareness from Immortals they know  they're just looking out for these  flanks for the Allin for dig that  explosive engage and Castle goes to Mark  the the critical component of that now  with no flash on XU is going to be much  more difficult for them to actually make  the huge play 211 stacks on the smolder  dignitas is trying to buy enough time to  get there but Immortals are tired of  letting him do it oay takes some poke  from the dragon snot bubble here comes  the M Immortals trying to stay tall of  the river now with O's in the middle of  two massive AOE WBO combo coming over  the top and D tries to dive in and mass  grab the kill back of the is XU is shut  down the dragon damage is pouring in 232  Stacks with to go as Castle tries to  fight Dove not enough HP to keep this  one going it's two dead on both sides a  3v3 in the bot side River but health  bars favor dignitas okay we got rich  still here with his blade of the Run  King he can melt through these Mountain  dragons Tomo here poking around they  want to wait for it though no jungle  Smite for them and they're too scared of  an armo steal they back off after the  leash flowers he got the stat now after  fight he is working through it now we're  going to see smolder really shine here's  another look at the engag though so they  got the nice slow with the stop bubble  like you called out mom came to follow  it up and then on the top side du duve  is working his way through Castle while  Olay went in for the counter engage and  rich just over the top finishes it off  so they get this big explosion tactical  and our Mayo got chunked out and had to  run away super early on but we aren't  done we're ready to go Tomo and the rest  to dignitas starting up the dragon Tomo  just going to keep spitting those  Fireballs trying to poke however he can  the Drake down to about 5,000 HP the mom  comes in over the top as it only hits  oay not a lot of value coming out from  that one Dragon still at 4K dignitas  trying to keep the health bars high but  Immortals are doing the same thing Rich  versus Castle here in the botside river  as Castle takes the burst but Rich  disengages back over the wall o ready to  follow up here with the engage XU locked  down but Immortals have to back away  Isles explod way Paints the Masterpiece  and it's written in the blood of  dignitas Rich tries to stay alive as  Dove wants to escape back of the wall he  won't be sniped down but it ain't going  to matter Tomo and Dove still alive  there's a oneman Advantage for immortals  Dove still trying to get away as mask  wants to chase him not quite enough  range to get that done here yet wanted  to see about a snipe again Dove getting  that wave shoved up the Drake now  finally going to be finished off by  Immortals I feel like this was a 4minute  drake sequence it was it was that was  part two this this was a sequel here  from The dignitas Immortals Banger  flowers I love live patch we have so  much to go over in this look at that  Engage The Root caller actually delayed  Dub's followup so it could have been  even bigger for dig but Quay damage  explodes on digitas as they're grouped  up after it even with the giant engage  and then Castle gets to run through them  chasing them  off so much fun here trying to keep up  with uh all of the extra explosions and  in the middle of it all too well there  you go  5.4k The Quay explosions that's what we  kept warning about the massive AOE  potential of this Immortals lineup that  they've drafted here in these mid and  late game team fights he's he's so scary  if everybody just wants to have a  meatball wrestling match it's not going  to work out so great if here against him  hes getting locked down by Ole here on  the front again a little bit of damage  that Way's looking for not going to  connect in time on the back end of  things remember that spell will do bonus  damage if you are immobilized or  isolated MH and the bonus damage is a  bunch it's like a rocket yeah you don't  want to get hit by that thing a lot of  people too pretty popular in Solo que is  going for the Horizon focus never mind  though as XU is flanked around they're  going to teleport and go for the  collapse dig TOS trying to find their  fight here is coming in for the followup  mortal trying to get everybody away but  tactical is thrown up into the air he's  caught he's down Mo comes in over the  wall but she ain't even needed just yet  Castle trying to fight in the middle of  four he needs the Q3 to come down for  the healing but he's going to be shut  down by Tomo before it happens dignitas  just killed two and one of them's the ad  carry now they have health bars a little  bit dicey here for is and Dove but  they're heading back over to Baron what  a call from dig there the game on the  edge and they're going to be able to  make the critical pick tactical and  Castle both down Isles here very low  doesn't have hope but they're going to  teleport Rich right back in they want to  bring Dove back into this fight he had  to go back and heal but the unleash TP  is ready to go Immortals do not want to  lose the remaining three players Dove  steals away a cloned Daisy and baron  goes to dignitas dignitas they may be  down dragons but they're up in Gold  they're up Baron now and they should be  able to get more afterwards St here  trying to push with  Daisy Mass going to have to be careful  you got to respect the daisy knockups  finally going to kill that one off tier  one turrets still being just chipped  down by this cannon minion blessed by  Dove one more oh no he got distracted  yeah the stolen away AP Daisy gives her  uh some extra oomph there and Dove will  be able to keep it keep up the pressure  here take down outer turret number one  see if they can get bottom Lane moving  as well for dignitas cuz the rest of the  team has gotten their full reset and  their purchases Tomos went for the rapid  fire Cannon this by the way since your Q  range on smolder is the same for your  your auto attack then it increases your  Q range for the rapid fire and you can  get some nice long range Fireball poke  going for tomo especially now that he's  got the upgrades the extra true damage  this dragon is scary man  37 Stacks let me look at what that says  then so every Q which is on a 2.2 second  cool down if you don't hit something  with theori cool down reduction 6.5% Max  HP true damage over 3 seconds if you  drop below N9 boom you're dead that you  add those together it's 15% if he hits  you and you are at 15% HP it'll take you  a couple seconds but you're dead that's  almost Elder move over Zary we've got a  new late game yeah this guy is going to  be trouble for immortals the further  this game goes but right now it's  Immortals that are having to respond to  dig dig Nas are driving the car and  they're headed straight for the IMT  structures all right couple more hits  yeah bottom Lane too is work worked up  here rich on the level 16 Yon bottom  putting pressure on castle with these  bared up minions whittling away at  bottom Tower while the mid lane Tower  was slowly being whittled down but they  know they have to get ready they have to  get reset and ready for this Dragon  because while they are now up almost  5,000 gold for dig they're still facing  multiple dragon souls that they're going  to have to deal with in this game even  if they defend this first one they  constantly have to be worried about this  objective coming up so did get their  reset off in order to prepare for dragon  all right let's see it man 20 seconds  dignitas want to keep this control going  the baron is going to last just long  enough for the Drake to First spawn Tomo  is happy to just be left on his own to  farm up all these waves get all those  free Stacks that's a thing too late game  smolder with a Mobility with your cool  down reduction from your quick blades on  uh your flat flap flap just feels like  he's able to kite so well yeah and with  all the melee protection here they do  have a lot of PE  Olay going to take a lot of burst here  from the front line he not tanky enough  Leona's already dead BR went in to  create space to guarantee the kill then  he can use the soul Unbound to reset his  position and get right back out now  Castle immediately losing half HP there  to the smolder has to retreat and  dignitas I would have to think they've  all but secured their Drake here as Mas  gets to flash out the mom damage over  the top again not going to find any huge  payoff but Immortals have already been  forced back yeah that's going to be  Dragon Defense number one compl complet  for  dignitas secured here Dragon poke in  Middle oay Down Easy Drake pick up and  they retain pressure in both mid and  bottom Immortals trying to farm up there  Zary tactical here doing his best with  the new static shiv uh this game you  know still possibilities of trying to  have a Zer moment later on into the game  once you get a couple more uh you know  items coming through here he's already  on three has has his own quick blades  Aro went with the staff of flowing water  for the extra AP and move speed buff  here which is very good to put on mask  as well for the positioning for the H  for the amplification there too so we'll  see Immortals their hopes still alive in  this game they do have the advantage in  wave clear of course they are the ones  with a way they've got some nice uh bits  of range here they've got the  electricity on their side as well so  they're trying to stall it out they're  trying continue to farm it up here but  it's just ominous when you're across the  the rift from a smolder and now it's a  four item completed smolder with the  armor penetration from Lord Doms coming  in it's Tomo's time to shine baby yeah  he's set to carry man and I agree I  think that Immortals yeah you can still  win but everything's got to be set up  perfectly qu needs massive AOE Zer needs  to have that Zer moment as the mid lane  tier 2 turret Falls dignitas keep their  push going also I want to keep a magnif  find glass on Dove take a moment to talk  about him from dignitas because he has  not really been in the spotlight there  were a couple games where like he got  that air Quadra and they were trying to  come back but then they didn't get the  comeback so didn't get a lot of the  credit there but his stus is actually  almost about to complete a death cap  he's got two of the needlessly large  rods he's up to 17 now he's got the  extra amplification here the uh the  lichbane as well has been doing work and  a lot of this burst coming through so  we'll see currently they're splitting up  into the one through one for dignitas  both Dove and Rich with their teleports  ready and looks like Dove himself up to  the tower with that Lit Bane nice little  chunk here yeah I mean when you look at  the when you look at the 11 kills of  dignitas raan's been there for nine of  them Silas for 10 of them re for all 11  the setup here has been pretty fantastic  for these guys in the fights all working  together for these efforts but they  still have to crack the enemy base  there's 13 seconds until Baron spawns  again Tomo trying to make sure he does  not get caught XU speeding him up just  making sure they can both walk away from  this one all right we're cool we're  chilling okay look at all these wards  that you could teleport flank on too  though as Immortals push out yeah they  need to collapse back into their own  territory here nice move from Immortals  they know it's getting a little  dangerous on the other half of the map  it's it's been in dignitas control for  so long it's littered with Wards all  right dignitas with control over the top  side River control over the baron pit TP  coming in they want to make sure that  everybody's ready to join in for this  one dove has the stolen way ulti that  spiraling despair that incredibly  effective clumped up team fighting tool  dignitas are not going to start the  baron just yet they're going to wait for  immortals to approach and hope to punish  Castle wants to walk up here from this  angle but he's got to be careful Tomo  again they're going to put some damage  into Ole Castle could be caught as rich  and X both go in but they ain't going to  find the mark smolder Al goes wide  Immortals regroup they're going to be  healed and shielded by Aro diver but now  which wants to drive in it's O right in  the middle of everybody but Tomo's ready  to counter attack Castle wants the  smolder but he ain't going to find him  Tomo's already killed off too and now  Immortals where can you even go a triple  kill back to smolder dignitas are ready  to March it down mid for the Nexus yeah  I think Immortals going to have to go  back to the gray screen dignitas  knocking on the front door Rich keeping  the dive alive as tactical has to flash  out just to survive it dignitas with a  fiveman push keeping things going for  119 stacks on the smolder level 18 now  they should just Brute Force this down  10 seconds on oay 25 on the two solo  laners of Immortals as tactical will not  live through it Isles and the rest of  dignitas will get this done they will  tie Immortals in the standings and take  them out in 34  minutes  digitas another victory over  Immortals the first first ones to use  smolder and a really exceptional  performance on the silus from Dove yes  sir bringing it all together so much fun  to watch both of these squads iow will  dominate actually had a really nice  tweet about the LCS and the the level  here of the players in this split really  leading to the thought process of anyone  could be anyone right now these teams  are really Scrappy and theyve they've  shown in a lot of these  games some really strong team fighting I  also like that we got to see some high  moments for H even though there wasn't a  victory for immortals there were some  real pop off moments in those team  fights where he got that ideal situation  and really showcased the strengths of  the champion I hope we get to see both  of these Champions some more I agree  with you it's part of the fun of live  patch is you just always get to see the  newest and most exciting things  happening and getting to see these two  go head to-head in their debut for LCS  for both was a lot of fun honored all  yall during the 2024 spring split you  can use your master card to make a  purchase from the in client store save  that card on file to be entered for a  chance to win a trip to A League of  Legends event or eight player of the  week statues right now we're headed to  break before 100 thieves versus TL but  first let's take a look at this year's  first are you smarter than featuring a  brand new  host this Pro taught himself English  through talking to an AI I got bait I  got ba list as many items that build  from this specific item these guys are  nerves I am going to give you eight  players put them in order from youngest  to  oldest this time it's are you smarter  than LCS Pro because analysts we got  them out here they don't know um we have  fly Quest versus jitas here we're going  to start off with new Champions I am  going to start to read an ability to you  you have to say the champion and the  ability each of your teams vote who's  your first  vione of  it's not me bro I don't know any of all  right hands behind your back oh that's  important yes are you ready molten  fissure that is h q e yep two points to  fly Quest you guys are good I would have  not even the really all right maybe  we'll be seeing some support way from  fly who's next okay I go next y you  can't you can't just keep sending boio  up you know I'm sure I know the meta all  right Crimson  curse can you lose points if you guess  wrong you do not lose points if you  guess wrong but if you guess wrong it  goes automatically to the other team and  they can talk can I  press you do not know it you still can't  discuss your team I'm going to now read  the ability and give you the ability  type for one point this Champion gains 0  to 50% based on missing Health increased  healing based on her missing health and  her attacks and abilities apply  uh Briar passive yes nice thank you  thank  you all right I'm getting in there oh GG  it's it might be lost yeah it's going to  be a feel  now all right crushing  Maul yes has to be enough here e  nope so you guys now get to discuss  amongst yourselves for two points so if  they if you you can talk to them I got  baited I got baited I got baited I got I  think it's Bri I think it's Bri I think  it's his e the one where he's like  screaming no that's no that's something  Screech or scream I think it's fine they  don't know like look at them oh it is he  it's think all right all right  answer yes we knew all right same  matchups was your backup I I think I  can't win this match up apparently it's  just one darken  daggers NE yes let's go two points I was  slow I was slow got the easy one let's  go he was fast all right when can I take  my head out of my back like the moment  you say the first letter of the question  yep certain  death Naf no  it's yes let's go I'm sorry guys we're  on the up and up we're on the up it up  last one for for uh Champions ready  eviscerate the fury e yes wow bro I I  played him in Aram two days ago first  time ever playing the shamp wow these  guys are nerds that just wraps up up  round one we'll see you after next game  look what I've just  made the perfect Pearl not too bad but  check this  out waa a true Venus clam Red Bull gives  you  wings the new Red Bull C blue Edition  with the taste of  Juneberry wings for for every  [Music]  taste  [Music]  [Music]  what's up everyone I've got the  Victorious Tomo here for this interview  after a  win how is that game from your  perspective it felt hectic as  hell yeah I think we made a lot of  blenders early game but thankfully our  team comp is pretty strong I have  smolder so I just went my late game as  you saw um so yeah you had like  something like 422 Stacks at the end  like we expected if there was going to  be a smolder player it would be you it  felt like you were playing the pick in  Solo CU a lot even before you guys were  scouting me a little bit okay we were  aware okay so we were watching um just  your thoughts on the champion overall  because now you you got finally got to  pull it out first smolder in LCS first  region to be able to play it yeah I was  playing in scrims a lot and it just felt  really good for our team in general I  think it fits our play style um and yeah  I really enjoy the champion I think it's  really exciting and fun to play so it  just helps with that too just like it's  more engaging to play I've seen a lot of  bad smolders out there in Solo can you  give us any like tips or tricks just  anything that you've seen people mess up  on the most that you learned on your  like week and a half I guess in playing  the champion honestly just just Farm  you're really fragile game obviously  like you're a little dragon you just  want to farm camps you know like later  on I was just eating every single Camp  my jungler just like offered everything  to me so yeah just scale once you get  sacked you're just broken I think that  was the trick cuz of course I guess oay  chased you on the like second base got  you on a kill on Bush yeah we don't talk  about  that we don't talk about that from that  point forward your comes like give me  all Sid lanes and farm at that point  yeah um it's especially important on the  fourth Q evolve so 225 sacks it was like  a dragon fight I think Third Dragon or  something it was uh pretty game changing  I got it like midf fight so then we  actually it contribut to winning us the  fight sweet I appreciate the tips thanks  again you're for sure going to be on  this stage again we got 100 in TL next  thanks guys have a good one thank  you  [Music]  apprciate  [Music]  [Music]  B so welcome back y'all we got a little  Caster swapo in time for game three it's  your boys ra and Asel once back again  and as we get ready for this draft we  saw our first whe and smolder picks in  the LCS with some Crazy Fire coming  between both teams but now with 100  thieves and Team Liquid on the horizon  here one of the things we have to look  at right away is that before when they  first met up in the very first week of  the LCS we had high expectations for  team open against  thev Bo 100 th they saw what dign TOS  were cooking they're like we cannot  allow this through the draft guys yeah I  was hoping we were going to get cast  molder game cuz I've been playing a fair  bit of this champ and I think it is  really really strong it is definitely a  lot of fun to watch on 143 first week of  it it's going to be a banger yeah but as  I was saying before 100 thieves the  first time they met up against Team  Liquid they were talented as the not  favored team and they completely came  back against Team Liquid and showed us  that that these guys have a lot more  than what they're were really perceived  to be before the season started  absolutely I mean at the end of the  first round robin 100 thieves they are  tied for second place way above where  everyone had them in this standing so it  is really exciting we got some fans from  Korea for respect  they here for the Fearless Admiral oh my  goodness the general himself we'll see  how TL is going to be doing today uh  it's going to be a fun matchup I think  you know between these two teams impact  and sniper this was our season opener  here uh these two players going up  against each other it was the blind pick  Riven I believe it was uh game if we  remember counter it was counter pick  excuse me up against the impact I  believe that was one of the only losses  he actually had on the uder he was  playing into the uder was a game thatl  was winning able to bring it back with  some really great double TP plays some  good flanks that were able to turn  things  around but no uder for uh impact in this  one and uder has just been going crazy  in the LCS coming into this week it was  10 and two in the LCS it was basically  every win for TL was impact playing on  uder this guy had been playing it every  single time it's up he is going to be on  the Cante this time around and Yan will  get his hands on the kalista which is  really high pry going to be interested  to see if it's going to be a lane  pairing you know more those range  supports alongside it or if it is going  to be more of an aggressive kind of old  school engage style that we used to see  a lot more and something that we've  already seen patter liquid in the past  games losses were when they try to go  for more early Focus game strats trying  to prioritize solution and just try to  steamroll the game those didn't really  work out in their favor the games that  they have won a lot of late game  priorities so this one Team Liquid they  don't want to just be identified as well  if we don't scale then we we lose right  so Team Liquid trying to have a little  bit more of that early game pressure and  try to prove against the 100 thieves  that they can actually beat them with  something that is proactive early yeah  see with the smolder record tracker on  on the poster in the in this what I want  to see is can you track the stacks you  know be a hard poster to update' be hav  to put a lot up there but we are getting  the vi and tiia tiia buffed on this  patch uh we saw energy running this  combo earlier did not work out that well  for him but I do think it's a great  answer to kalista kalista when you are  on that un Earth if you are hopping  around you it is very very difficult um  you know you can get locked down by that  by point and click engage try to flip in  that kalista burst her down if you try  to use a q or anything like that as the  kalista on that unraveled Earth you are  going to get stunned up um you know with  that little hop from the que y um also  obviously you know ver pretty strong  later here so maybe seeing some of these  potential jungle pairings getting banned  away or rather support pairings uh the  Olaf going to get taken away from sniper  we saw one game I believe from him it is  something that a lot of Pros who are  comfortable playing these aggressive  matchups do really like as one of those  into Cante it is something that you can  run over obviously you have a lot of  true damage on the E U but you can kind  of just really brawl very very heavily  with the Cante and you can kind of just  run this guy down Cante you know is  definitely I think a lot weaker these  days than some of the 1 V ones Kobe our  volar one trick in the house made it all  the way to Grand Master last season yeah  true shout outs to Kobe man grinding on  a champion that most junglers would  never ever pick in this meta or you know  maybe for quite some time a lot of  movement speed items are gone but as we  close out this second draft phase and I  want to highlight for 100 thieves as you  already pointed out this VI to Lea combo  is going to be a huge huge threat for  team liquid's carries not just kalista  as well but for Oriana because that  season assist easy combo to lock in for  the toa's Full Burst I want to see what  team liquid is going to round out this  composition with I imagine that if you  want to go for that lame pryo you want  to go for something like an enchanter  support for cor JJ yeah it absolutely  could do that but Nas also really is  very powerful you know these sorts of  pairings do give you that hard engage  this is kind of what the old school way  of playing kala was people would always  pair it with Nautilus or Alistar or  these types of hard engage picks  nowadays they've been playing a lot more  with enchanters Rana I always think is  kind of that best pairing with it but it  is Band Away uh said dwani looking like  that'll be the lock so going to give  themselves a little bit more time to  decide what they want for that counter  pick down in bot Lane if you're trying  to win the 2v2 you want to see what  support Hunter thieves are going to be  going towards Hunter thieves obviously  need their Top Lane they need their  support so they're going to have to make  some decisions here maai support is  still quite strong on this patch um and  there's a tiny tiny chance of it playing  top I've been seeing a couple people  mess around with the Top Lane again uh  but I think if it gets locked it's  almost 100% chance going to support yeah  we'll have to see what 100 theves last  pick of the the draft is to make sure  but if it were something like a maai it  would add on to how many point and click  tools you have to lock something  slippery down like this kalista which to  be honest close so far it is going to be  the most consistent damage threat that  Team Liquid have in their pocket so hro  going to be the pick here for Sniper hro  Sante pretty solid matchup uh you can  definitely scale well into this you know  generally is considered to be pretty  strong in a tanks you have a good amount  of sustain it's difficult for tanks to  kind of wear you down on their own uh we  have been seeing HX do really poorly uh  in the LCS this split but largely it has  been into uder which is just such a  strong early laner that even though at  TRX is considered good in tanks you kind  of just lose to udor anyway it's not the  same story here with Cante uh so I do  think it's going to be a preferential  match up for Sniper up in the Top Lane  and we have Alistar as the pick here for  Aya so looking for a little bit of hard  engage there more setup for that toia  you're not just going to be relying on  that V ultimate the engage can come  through from Alistar set up things like  the Veris ultimate the Varys q and flips  in as well CJ if he goes back to T this  is something that he was actually really  well known for this was back to the  double LIF days when he was playing with  double LIF they did a lot of I want to  say it was Sonic um one of the kind of  first bot Lanes in our league that we're  doing a lot of that and we're going to  get the tri pick here this is first of  the split I believe for definitely four  core and I want to check if it's first  at like total I'm going to double check  on that but uh this is something that he  is very comfortable with it's a really  strong scaling support it's very very  powerful as well you know with that  kalista um to be able to have that  ultimate in you give you that safety to  go aggressive you use that car ultimate  offensively ideally so you try to start  out the fight you try to look to get  really high value from that especially  against a team that has really  telegraphed hard engage as soon as the V  starts flying in VI can't cancel that  and say just kidding ter presses are and  as long as you keep you alive you could  potentially with good timing deny that  whole VI to Le a combo that they've been  drafting for so really excited to see  how they're going to play this out the  weakness of course is that trick is not  a super strong laner you don't have a  lot of presence in Lane but that being  said against melee supports like the  Alistar as long as you're getting those  Autos out for the passive cooldown  reduction to be able to get more heals  more ease out uh you can still have  quite a bit of value right and I I have  to say the pivot from Nautilus into  Alistar for AA gives a little bit of  flexibility as well because normally  once you go in with Nautilus you're also  kind of in there with Vai but with  Alistar if you want to just punt someone  away or knock us someone as they go in  for the entrance that is at least some  peeling ability that you'll have and  it's more flexibility for this over 100  th composition but as you pointed out  Cosmic radians on the side of core JJ  great timing on that can deny so much  burst and that early burst of damage  from the side 100 thieves as they look  for the initial pick which allows for  that second fight to be super successful  for them absolutely and I did check it  out to confirm it is not only the first  T pick of the LCS is the first T pick  this season of any of the top four major  regions so no one has picked it yet so  another one LCS has been really popping  off with so many different unique picks  this year it has been really fun to  watch and corejj going to add another  one to the list here with the T and  we're heading on into game hundred  thieves versus TL week four the LCS you  know what we got a shout out Mark Z once  again thank you kamish it is solely  because of you we are getting tck in  this game there's no other reason I  refuse to believe it as yep and if they  lose direct all complaints to the markz  on Twitter his DMS are open on Twitter  loves  that all right as we take to the rift  first opening seconds of the game  nothing too fancy here it's just a  defensive line of scrimmage from both  sides maybe quid goes in for a little  bit of poke here but it's just the  standard emote game from APA he throws  up the ton and quid will look for the  reset yep quid going to be looking for  that  reset um it's going to be really  interesting to see how he actually  performs on this till again you know as  I mentioned did get some Buffs on this  patch they're going to help a lot with  the push the base damage on your Q went  up which is very significant you know  even though it is only a small number it  was increased by about 10 I believe um  because you were spimming it out it's  very significant and also the E coold  down got flat reduced to I believe 14 at  all ranks now um so the wave clear is a  lot better and when TOA can get out of  Lane it is so impactful to be able to  move around the map to really be able to  make things happen so going to be  interesting to see you know who gets  push is it still going to be the oron as  you would expect previous patch or will  those Buffs have have shifted things  enough that quid could actually be the  one getting push yeah and to kind of  scope it out here aale I know there is a  lot of things to talk about narratively  for both of these teams especially from  what we saw in that first round robin  match but where are you kind of looking  at first in these few openings I think  you're going to be watching bot Lane you  know I do think these bot lanes are are  going to be pretty spicy uh anytime you  have kalista if it gets ahead of the the  pace of the game it's going to be  important um but we also have to be  looking up towards Top Lane you know  that Riven the first time around that I  talked about this was sniper and impact  in 2016 in 2016 this is a 10-year-old  sniper and this was not the career debut  for impact by the way he played and his  debut was back I want to say was a 2012  or 2013 in Korea so sniper would have  been like six when impa started playing  pro league which is crazy to think you  also have to give so much respect over  to impact it's not just that he's been  playing for a long time this guy has  been dominating at the top level for so  long has won so many championships has  won championships on three different  rosters I want to say in the LCS alone  has gone to International continued to  keep that level of play up so it is so  cool to have you know one of our  absolute greatest veterans in the entire  game not even just in the LCS this guy's  been so good for so long and then he is  going up against sniper one of the  absolute youngest players this kind of  rising star who has so much promise and  it'll be really fun to see who comes out  on top of this because you impa was very  confident that sniper wasn't really  going to be able to do much of anything  against him last time but sniper came  out on top so impact definitely is not  going to be wanting to lose again yeah  the exciting contrast and it shows how  long our esport has been around for the  fact that you can have someone like  impact with such a 10ar career now  playing against someone who has been a  hyped up prospect that we've known about  since he was 12 13 years old first  hitting Challenger and when upon making  his debut guys he picked Riven against  impact and won and he won now refused to  elaborate ref you know what you're right  refuse to elaborate let the results uh  dictate um but it's definitely it's  definitely wild it's it's been  interesting right because I think that  when we've talked to a lot of the top  laners they're like yeah sniper's not  that good you know they're not that that  impressed by him you know but his his  stage results I think have been speaking  for themselves I think he's doing a lot  better than people were expecting U most  people that I were talking I was talking  to you know prior to the split were  saying yeah he's going to have a rough  start you know he he's not there yet we  think he could get there but he's not  there yet and it's going to be a tough  uh beginning of his career in the LCS  you know maybe should have taken another  split in academy or something like that  but here he is and he is performing on  stage you know has been doing well yeah  and I'll put myself on blast I was in  that camp where I was like man they are  bringing in Sniper a little way too  early I'm wrong guys I put 100 thieves  at seventh in this preseason power  rankings I was also wrong my bad also  shout out to David shock who put me on  blast as well it's like it's okay like  100 thieves came with a Vengeance and  they are really pulling a high so far in  this first season uh first round robin  record yeah absolutely it's it's also  fun you know just talking about the Top  Lane there's so much to talk about  because they have such a different style  these two players right in the Shar  champion pool very little share between  these two players just like Cante in  fact in fact has been you know very much  back to the tanks a lot of talk about  how strong tank itemization is in this  season King of Rooker frozen heart you  know plushes bomy that has become kind  of the big three that every tank is  rushing for uh and impact has kind of  been you know having that recipe for  Success where over on the other side  it's very clearly more towards that  aggressive play different style of  Champions coming out from sniper that's  the style that he has kind of made made  his own and uh what he really wants to  be known  for First 5 minutes have passed both the  little grubbies as well as the first  dragon has spawned neither jungler has  made an inclination to really play for  it quite yet but most of the push has  been favoring 100 thieves so far after  this last shove in but there's a moment  where they're looking for a reset do  Team Liquid want to try and find the  dragon here it looks like they are going  to you know especially if that bot Lane  does reset I have to say though Yan is  basically tapped on Mana as well River  now has  that this is going on and it is Hun  thieves with the bot Lane push right now  cor is going to make the first move over  here but again Yan basically out of Mana  completely um m is imp parity this might  just be a bit of a flip but it does look  like Hunter theves have made a decision  no APA is going to be moving down and  that will force them to back off yeah  APA getting that first shove was super  crucial for Team Liquid because as you  called out Yan was not high on combat  power at the time but having that four  versus three potential Advantage secures  in the dragon and because River  committed that time over wait a minute  they might look for something here on  the bot Lane if he wants to look for Q  and Flash not going to commit it just  going to play cool yep and river is  there to cover so you know had he  overcommitted like that trying to go for  a q flash W uh likely would have been  really heavily punished here quid trying  to push up potentially going to look for  an angle to stop that recall but APA far  enough back that it won't be able to  happen and quid just going to be trying  to clear out this wave as fast as  possible he knows he needs to hover his  bot Lane they know River could be around  and River's going to show river is still  charging up the que but as soon as shows  River decides not to engage this is  really tricky cuz as you already it as  once either VI or Sani commits if they  cannot get out as there's a flash  already in the top side sniper popping  the ultimate as well impact going all  out as well lot of damage sniper wins  the 1 V1 what a flash there from sniper  as well impact tried to knock him back  into the tower and try to look for that  Alti to go all out and pull him under  the turret but sniper early flashes and  it means that the Cante Al pulls him  away from the tower instead and sniper  just pops the Alti turns it around we  can watch this one more time we've seen  it a thousand times if you've seen it  once it is E4 Q3 try to W him back in  the turret then look for the all out but  that flash meant impact is going the  wrong way he's low he doesn't have the  assistance that he was counting on from  the tower and this is just great stuff  here from sniper slams him down for the  isolated First Blood there in the Top  Lane and he is looking happy about that  he's almost shocked he's like oh my God  I just did that Viper if you're watching  right now I cannot imagine how proud you  are watching your little bro go from  week one super nervous on the LCS stage  now solo killing the same opponent now  in week four I mean their whole family  is just insane at League of Legends the  Viper you know former LCS Pro Crimson  Challenger player sniper now LCS Pro all  three brothers are Challenger uh those  parents just need to have two more kids  then they can have a full LCS Squad  themselves it could definitely be the  angle as team quit are able to secure  the grubs for themselves still forward  in the front line massive shock wave  tries to bring them all in but that  unreel from quit did a lot of damage  already taking down on APA Force The  Flash but the flash committed as well  quid is just cooking up Team Liquid on a  platter as now core JJ and impact are  forced to run but core's not getting out  100 thieves are running away with the  game on this one yeah they are crushing  him it's a three for zero on that top  side after already getting this solo  kill up in the Top Lane look at sniper  now picks up another kill two assists as  well well as TL we trying to commit very  heavily to this but they don't have a  lot of damage here it's really just APA  and three tanks so all 100 thieves had  to do is keep APA out of the fight the  shock wave was big but at the end of the  day this is an early game Oriana and  then you see this turn as soon as the  APA steps forward for that shock wave he  just gets aled by river river had held  that the entire time waiting for him  knowing that Oriana was the only true  threat with him eliminated there's  nothing the rest of the squad can do and  they're looking happy about it 100 th  cruising early on in this game already a  quick replay of both of the young solo  laners from 100 thieves popping off and  having a good time and I just have to  say it might have been a mismanage I'll  hold up another fight on the top side  sniper now 2v one I don't think he's  getting out of this one with a little  bit of help impact gets the shutd down  yeah nice gake there up on the top side  Mt going to get up towards Top Lane and  this time as you say they're going to be  able to burst him down I think sniper  likely was sitting on a fair bit of gold  as well we'll see if he does actually  have a buy yeah he's sitting on 11100  more gold so close to that that one item  completion so even though uh you know he  is up a lot in Gold he's not at that  full combat power po JJ and Y still have  flash so they're still safe I thought it  looked like maybe River was going to try  to all in with that cease and assist but  they have enough distance to get away  yep going to be able to cleanse and walk  it out so the profane Hydra now  completed you know that's the item that  you're kind of waiting for it is so  powerful on the H rocks really on a lot  of Champions we've talked about it a lot  but because it has that bonus damage on  the active below 50% HP be any Champion  with a lot of upfront burst it's very  easy to knock your opponent in these  trade patterns down and then try uh-oh  AP doesn't have Flash from that grub  fight before easy combo for the to to  follow up shock wave tries to P them  back but he's still dead and gone three  straight kills now for quid three Z and  one on the Tia looking good showcasing  the power of this combo and that is  something I want to say you know river  is so good at is punishing missing cool  Downs if you think back to that last  game as there there's a skirmish here I  think core maybe can walk it out hey he  might have the flash here it's the fat  call from Yan that keeps him safe and  keeps the Summoner spell intact that was  actually so close though he really held  that ultimate long and another flip in  there from quidd he is just kind of on  fire right now but think zingle one here  so far it feels like it oh God  okay Aya igniting his former B Lane Duo  just saying n buddy you can't back there  where did Hong come to  that's crazy I didn't even know he was  here with that with that priority  thieves are just going to be able to get  this second dragon of the game  absolutely but I really want to touch  back on on the first game that they  played against each other it was River  on by it was AP on Zig and he punished  him so badly on the missing Summoners  quid may have to be flashing out of this  situation we'll see already using the  prison there River engages cor JJ  flashes back but the [ __ ] gradient pops  but Team Liquid don't have another way  to engage so theves just get out yeah  exactly and again this game you know  River now on that top side they fight  over by the herald in trouble oh but  nice from Impact using the allout to  dodge that last Q3 from sniper he's able  to survive for now oh pulling him back  in the tower but no turret shot no  punish man this is a really Scrappy game  you know anytime I try to talk about it  another fight breaks out that's the life  of the color Caster go um but yeah RI  River's just into Incan at actually  punishing missing cool Downs CU that's  that's kind of the tldr he did it in the  previous game between these two teams  was able to do it here again you know  forced out the flash from APA with his  ultimate at the herald fight got the  kill anyway then immediately goes back  mid kills him again before flashes up  this is something this guy is really  well known for when you're talking to  these other Pros he is so frustrating to  play against um because he really  understands the gank timings very very  well knows exactly when he can drop  camps uh when he can actually make these  moves to make something happen  here with that priority both already  gained from mid lane you get the grubs  for free on the side of 100 thieves so  it denies Team Liquid from getting all  six as we're going to get a chance to  look at our Kia multi Lane on both mid  jungle and bottom Lane Yan and core  having successfully push meech off of  the tower because Alo went for a ro to  cover mid lane during that time so it  looks like they at least get one turret  plate out of it but the grubs are  awarded over to 100 thieves yep going to  be able to trade the grubs for that so  not that big a deal you lose a plate on  bot side yon has not really been  accelerated too much he's actually going  for a pretty defensive build here as  well you know did go for the early  tabies uh knows that it is going to be  you know likely vers by hro all kind of  rushing down towards him engage from a  do they really want to take this one  chain of Corruptions already as well but  it's the teleport coming in it's double  teleport to Zale both sniper and quid  are arriving to the party a 4v2 on bot  Lane yon tries to pull in cor The Flash  it's not enough quid takes him out both  100 thieves youngsters they're flashing  forward to follow sniper and quid  instant response that flash out from Yan  they're able to burst him down and going  to be able to get a nice punish here  take at least one plate away and there  could be an angle for red but they're  not going to risk it cuz it is that s w  very tanky with the frozen heart already  completed uh small victory on the top  side as it will be a play going the way  of impact to punish that TP down towards  botside from sniper but you hun thieves  again going to be feeling really happy  about this to the carries from TL just  feel like they can get no purchase in  this game you know it's 0 to0 for APA uh  the kalista on the Bots side has not  really been able to get the kind of  pryal that they wanted has not had that  lane dominance that they wanted so both  these guys have been put pretty far  behind and now this Rift Herald fight  Team Liquid are down cool Downs whereas  100 thieves the only one that could be  exposed here is quid which is already  why he is taking a defensive posture on  that left lane no flash Yan so that's  who they may be going for he's going to  have to position well let's see Yan is  already stepping up trying to see if he  can stack these the help for that spere  but as you called it out Aya is flanking  around APA has to guard and meanwhile  Rift Herald is secured by team liid but  now they pincered here as long as APA  can guide them out safely AA still  looking for the flank angle cor JJ  popping the COS radi all on the sniper  they cannot take any burst but now the  cosic radiance is gone but they're still  doing enough damage as they take out  meech sniper in the middle of all five  cannot get anything done River's going  to be next no one Falls from Team Liquid  they survive man the ter ultimate from  CJ was massive for TL in that fight AA  had the flank angle but the Alti lands  from core before he can actually get the  combo off they keep alive and it bought  so much time for Yan in this fight APA  does a good job marking a on the B side  of the screen but then watch the timing  here as it comes down the shock wave is  there that CC's up sniper Yan survives  right before that combo comes through  he's able to cleanse he's able to kite  back he's able to burst them down on the  other side impact as well was going  crazy in the all out it's all down to  that t timing if you hard engage with t  having that ultimate available you have  to be certain that you're going to kill  them before the T Al does fall in this  case hun thieves not able to do it and  TL from a deficit punish them hugely  getting a couple kills there for Yan so  not only does he complete that blade of  the Run King he's now got you know some  extra gold to boot going to be working  towards you know very likely um you know  rage blade yeah that first grub fight  100 thieves thought by taking the fight  at Rift Herald it was just a thought  thinking it was a rehearsal dinner for  them but Team Liquid showing what  happens when you actually have your  ultimates available for that fight and  how the composition is supposed to be  played out so now having experienced the  brunt end of that side 100 thieves have  to be a little bit more calculated of  when they are choosing to go in and  waiting out those cool Downs yeah  absolutely I mean you have to be perfect  with those engages you if you can nail  it you know there's not that many  threats over on the TL side if you get  that perfect initial engage you kill off  yon or you kill off APA there's probably  not enough damage in the tank you know  from that TL Squad to be able to win  through imp back in Sniper trading  heavily here river is going to find cor  JJ looking for the Dazz with the flash  the guaranteed right on top of it quid  is in there as well Weaver wall but Aya  is buying time on Y and APA Yan calls  over core JJ with that face call get the  two man knock up as well looking for The  Dazzle stun river right on top of Y no  damage to follow up sniper looking for  it but Y is cing around he's safe AP is  also safe Team Liquid running away with  the fight once again quin's in trouble  he's gone Team Liquid are smurfing on  100 thieves Y is starting to take over  these last couple fights the cool Downs  haven't been there from hun but it feels  like they're kind of halfhazard forcing  the play anyway you know we saw River  going with the ulti but there's no flash  on quid there's no flash on sniper  sniper didn't even have his ultimate to  try to follow up they can't get to the  backline and actually get these kills  and things are really starting to fall  apart here 400 thieves after what was an  incredible start out of nowhere they're  now down 2.5k they're down a dragon here  and it's starting to look pretty tough  for this 100 thieves Squad who had a  brilliant beginning to this game we can  watch this fight one more time uh this  flash for the stun from core was a  little bit surprising to me you know  looking for that Dazzle stun because yon  isn't really in position to follow up  quck comes in with the Alti they try to  just kind of Zone him out but then look  at that kind of miscoordination there AI  is flashing over the Tia Al to try to  get the combo on Yan but quid is going  for someone else he's not ready for that  he's not going for the flip in for that  seismic shove they have to be on point  with this then when sniper arrives he  doesn't even have his ulti he used it  down in bot Lan when he was scrapping  with impact so these core coold Downs  that you're dependent upon as his bur  composition are missing and the  coordination the communication was not  there you know a and quid of two  different Minds in that fight had Yan  been flipped in off that flash combo  from Aya it could look completely  different Yan being unchecked in this  fight we talked about it in the draft  phase that you have to look at this  kalista to being the most consistent  damage dealer if he's gone if he's taken  out early on then it's an easier win for  100 thieves but the fact that Yan  remains alive now puts more onus and  agency 400 these like really execute  these combos together yeah you have to  be perfect from this position especially  because you know Yan if he realizes the  only way that they can actually lose is  him getting 100 zero he can just go  Shield bone a he can start going really  kind of more tanky defensive itemization  doesn't have to necessarily maximize DPS  cuz everyone over on the 100 thieves  side is pretty squishy you don't like  you don't need a super high damage build  to deal with any of those those  teammates so uh I do think you can start  to look to go pretty tanky just make  sure you're not getting 100 to zero look  for those sorts of plays we could see  things like Knights vow coming out from  core we could see things like locket  coming out from core you just build  towards making sure they can't one shot  yawn and TL I think are going to be in a  pretty good spot so hun thieves are  going to have to make sure they are  absolutely on point in these next couple  fights when it does happen they've got  to be crisp with the engage they've got  to make sure that they're communicating  ahead of time to know when someone's  going to go in you know a has to be  saying I'm going to be looking for for y  on in this next flash hold your seismic  shove  yep almost 20 minutes into the game gold  lead in Advantage for Team Liquid by  3,000 looking for ya oh he tried to  perfectly cleanse it not quite so the  route is enough time for River to get in  range and look for the cease and assist  y just might be in trouble here still at  the flat waiting until the very end of  the cosmic radius it's going to keep him  alive AA tries P him in they finally  take out ywn can this fight be one from  100 at this point it's now up to apa to  see if he has the damage to be able to  last longer but quid already Falls what  can APA do here he's being kept back by  sniper as he is marking him and  preventing any more damage from Team  Liquid to come on in River now isolating  core JJ doesn't hit the Q but aa's there  to follow up with the knock up and core  JJ will fall yeah and the question is do  they go for anything more here with this  do they try to push for the tier one top  doesn't look like it just yet they are  just going to be taking the Scuttle  reclaiming submision we can watch this  one more time as Yan stepping forward  looking for an angle for the 1 V one  here against meech but he gets slowed up  by the ha L Aros slightly early on the  cleanse honestly didn't make much of a  difference I think that river is going  to get in range regardless here with the  Alti but then you can see the Bastion  shield with the w flashes forward gets  the Q heal as well from the T it does  come down that has got to be like 10 HP  okay 45 HP is what I see there in the  bottom left but at the end of the day AA  headbutts him back into the team Mee  gets a shut down sniper is there with  the Alti they have the cool Downs you  know quid getting locked up by that Alti  from umpt was really well placed they do  get a kill back on the other side but at  the end of the day they're just too  light on the damage it was only APA to  really be able to put out any pressure  and he wasn't going to be able to do it  at this point in the game and you can  just see we've already talked about it  before but this fight the state of this  game has been so hinged on whether Yan  is alive or not at the beginning of the  fight as impact might be picked off here  out already popped the ghost trying to  speed on out maybe he gets out of this  one wow he is a tanky boy so impact is  going to survive this one but that is  down a Summoner spell now in the next  couple of minutes actually under a  minute this next dragon will be spawning  and not having that cool down maybe it  doesn't hurt Team Liquid at the most but  it's going to make him less mobile yeah  is it is definitely you know impactful  in some of these fights uh at the same  time they did get Mee's Al out you know  had he died right before Baron or right  by Baron maybe they go with in trouble  AA right onto Yan but the COS of  gradians is there to guarantee no burst  will come throught is front loading all  the damage as well stunning up quid  meanwhile they find Yan onto the  backline but there's no damage to follow  up Yan is still alive AA trying to keep  him busy but AP is winning the fight for  Team Liquid while Yan is being kept busy  sniper wins one on the impact andp River  now still alive barely playing on an HP  this one not really going convincingly  to either side I mean it looked like it  was going to go heavily to TL but that  seismic shove from quid gets them two  kills there catching both Mt and impact  and now they're going to try to go for  Baron starting up on the other side does  TL actually make the move they're  starting to move but it's very late  they're going to leave yawn to finish  off the dragon a sniper dies to the  baron river is also super low he might  the bar Riv going  to the shield the healing is going to be  enough one more they can it it's a heist  baby and 100 theves are out of there oh  my God I thought they were going to have  to bail out for sure but they had good  enough Vision spotting APA the APA could  not get there in time to punish they do  lose sniper to the neutral and TL are  able to get a dragon on the other side  so they're going to be one off soul on  Soul point now but it's a good risky  move here from hun th toble to get  something back and let's watch this one  more time again it's all about can you  coordinate on the initial play Flash  Forward there from M but there's no  seismic shove available because umpty is  marking quid really good tank play here  fromt you know recognizing it's not the  threat of the engage I have to mark it's  the threat of the followup I have to  mark so he goes forward he gets the ulti  down on quid Quinn can't land that  seismic shove that one's not on him this  one he does nail which was really a bail  out because TL look at their health they  were crushing this fight they would not  have been able to get that bar without  that beautiful seism shove gets them two  kills they go to top side they do lose  sniper but they get the baron and they  keep themselves very close in this game  as far as gold obviously if you give  over ocean soul to a Sani trick as well  as Zante you're probably going to lose  the game um but at least they have an  opportunity here to look for those  fights a might be caught here no flash  available there's the stun from the  Perma Frost into the glacial prison Aya  using the ultimate to damage ruce all of  it River coming over the wall quit can  he find this iic shove onto the priority  Target it's on the core JJ that's not  really ideal river is going to be  falling for that one impact making sure  that sniper can't get into the fight  either all out still available but not  needing it as he's going to be able to  kite this one now Team Liquid taking the  away the advantage that they already  took out River five on Four Strong in  the map I mean river is just way too far  behind to be any sort of a solo threat  onto on so there he finds the Q on ywn  but there's an immediate lock it an  immediate W Shield there from the T as  well plus the heal comes through they  never going to be able to H zero this  guy before the ultimate comes down so he  has to use the ultimate actually to  retreat to try to get back over the TOA  wall to try to get out of there but  there was no ability to really follow up  and if they can't threaten yawn they  clearly cannot win these fights we've  seen it time and time again you know  quit had a pretty good angle over the  wall looking for that seismic shove but  it was still into that t ultimate so  nothing really came of it and TL are  going to be able to win another fight as  corejj passes exal for n most assists  all time special definitely one of the  early legendary players in the LCS you  know his days with TSM remembered very  fondly by  many I even for a brief time too on Team  Liquid it came over when they were still  cursed and then rebranded over to Team  Liquid shout out to Alex Che as Team  Liquid going to be posing up here ready  to see what waves they can catch and see  if they can look for another pick here  AA still doesn't have Flash and he was  an easier Target for them to get last  time and that baited H thieves into that  fight every single time Team Liquid have  been playing so well around the cosmic  Radiance timing his impact ghing in  looking for an engage was ready to go  for Mee with that all out but Aya there  just making sure that he is marked and  impact does not find the pick yeah  impact know there's no point in going  for anything too risky the game really  is going in their favor so you don't  need to to roll the dice on something  like that right you know take only the  high percentage plays uh you can see  this is pretty questionable I'm not  going to lie Mt uh going for a heal cut  here oh the  execution the Executioner Sani it's a  little bit sus I'm I'm not going to lie  I mean the W does physical damage so  like it's not the worst thing impact  though might be in trouble The All Out  brings it right back with the infernal  chains that's a pick for 100 thieves and  going to Barr down mid lane yep well  we'll see Mt on the side here poking  away it's a great pick you can see  Hunter thieves pushing up Top Lane with  theia pushing in mid lane after that  kill on impact impact feeling a little  bit too confident you know sitting alone  against four under that Tower yes you  were tanky but you are not that tanky  you're not really aheading gold in fact  they are now down a couple thousand gold  after these couple Towers did fall 400  thieves so it's going to be all about  the setup here you know trying to  prepare themselves for this big fight  potentially you know you look on the  mini map look at all these Wards liter  in this entire area TL trying to  dominate Vision in that section of the  map really making sure that they are the  ones who are going to have all this info  around this next dragon flight uh it is  going to be coming up here pretty soon  and we'll see if they can dominate that  area because they get ocean soul they  probably just straight up win the game  and hun thieves are going to have to try  to reclaim vision and shout out to The  Observers showing that it's pure  Darkness for the side of 100 th walking  in could just be face they have to wait  for quid they can't just walk up because  even if it's someone tanky doesn't get  one shot you need your whole team there  to follow up so they're waiting for quid  coming out of Base they saw APA bot Lane  so now I think they're going to feel  confident to push through mid then walk  down to the river and try to reclaim  Vision that way uh you can see impact is  trying to hold that mid lane wave but if  he's shown there again you can try to  walk in with this fiveman squad yeah and  you you have the the number advantage  for the moment you just have to wait on  impa to be able to colle that  wave let's see here going get engaged on  by first SI catches core River trying to  front load and Mark impact on the other  side Yan and APA separated from the rest  of the front line so not much damage is  being traded right on back quid  maintaining this posture aggressively as  tries to get back into this banana brush  impact walking back on over as the  dragon stacking has begun with these Ren  Stacks from ywn Impact trying to see if  he can look quid weever comes in too  late as you called it as they already  use the glacial prison as defensively  But Here Comes sniper trying to look for  a flank but R War dictates flank on the  weakest side of the flank here cosic R  is going to be popped up as yon can now  dash aggressively in meanwhile they're  trying to turn on back but sniper is  going to be waiting in the wings as well  but yon turns right on back once again  but they've already lost dty in the  fight Team Liquid just have to pick to a  side and commit they cannot be just just  getting pulled apart in both of these  sides as H thieves have now marked up  for death River might go down to impact  it's one back over to Team Liquid but  quen with the flash finds APA Aya dis  engaging and being able to find APA as  well on the back end of it as well  thieves take a fight in their own yeah  quidd is going to be able to find a big  pick there on AP they get both the  carries they were too slow on the engage  here they were trying to buy so much  time they were waiting for Sniper who  was coming around from below the fight  but it was very difficult to fight past  the Oriana ball we see the snipers  trying to come in from the bot side but  it's all about Oriana zoning people out  on the other side once APA moves back  into this kind of area you can see  everyone from under Thief is able to  pile forward AA stepping up me is  stepping up quidd is stepping up they no  longer have that zone control and then  this Flash in so good from Aya catches  out Yan they burst him down they know  they need to get more they gave up ocean  soul which is massive and that ocean  soul regen paying dividends for imp back  already but then this Flash Forward from  quid APA trying to S side step it can't  quite get it earns them another kill so  they still have a chance in this game  but they know it is going to be really  difficult from this point three tank  items completed there for impa on the  top side two and a half done for umpty  and corejj there as well you know going  to be getting tankier and tankier it's  going to be so difficult to actually  punch through not only the initial kind  of damage that they have to get out but  now the ocean soul regen like if you  don't kill off Yan right off the bat he  can heal up a fair amount in that ocean  soul during the T ultimate that's extra  regen that is all more Health you're  going to have to be dealing with and he  has the wits end now so he has the  additional resistances from there with  that bf very likely could just be a BT  last you know really just trying to make  sure he's staying  alive 100 thieves a huge obstacle that  they have to overcome against ocean soul  Team Liquid they are ahead in Gold yes  but as you already pointed out yon is  going to be so tough to kill the raid  boss but quid this guy has leveled up so  much since his first split in the LCS  last summer so much more confidence from  this guy as he is is flashing  aggressively in these fights he doesn't  have Flash up for this next potential  fight but if there is Magic that can be  made it will be from this guy's hands  yeah absolutely and he does have that  Melo so they do have some sort of heal  cut at the very least uh Mel is  obviously a pretty cheap buy now so you  can kind of tech into that more easily  but that really is their only heal cut  right now and river does get stunned up  but um's in trouble a finds an engage on  umpty Mech is already done a decent  amount of damage Cosmic Radiance  prevents further burst coming in as  impact Mark sniper Here Comes AO looking  for the on there's the flip from Quin he  finds it once again shock wave is going  toay time but a still goes down Y is on  the left side Quin turns they got him  100 thieves they got both of the carries  and now Team Liquid are running for the  hills but impact is pinned against the  wall as quit finds him once again he  surely will take him out impact maybe  gets out alive at this point but 100  thieves still have five members to push  down for the Nexus yeah that should be  it 100 thieves I think they've done it  the tanks are hard to crack but they cat  jpa they catch y on and they burst them  down 100 thieves in their first match  against Team Liquid at the beginning of  the season so many were skeptical that  this team would not make much in this  season they said it was a heist in the  first week but 100 thieves just might  show that it's not a heist it's a  promise that this roster will deliver in  the spring split as River and the rest  of H thieves carry forward this momentum  looking for the last Nexus Tower they're  running out of minions but they will  persevere through a few more autoex will  do it 100 thieves take the  game 100  thieves another win for this team two  and zero now against TL on the split  starting off week four here with a bang  both their games you eerily reminiscent  of each other it feels like they start  out strong they dig themselves into a  little bit of a hole but then they're  able to come back through their  playmaking they're staying confident  they're staying aggressive and I've got  to say what a game from quid I think he  was incredible today on the Tia this guy  has leveled up massively from last year  we are seeing the promise that people  have been talking about with this guy  and we are seeing the team really step  up around him as well you know Mee  having a great game on the ver 71 and8  only died that one time 92 and8 for quid  as well a lot of the concern around this  100 te's roster was well who's supposed  to be the carry you have all these young  players we don't really know if they're  going to be able to be consistent we  don't know if you can count on them to  get it done when it matters most but  here they were able to do just that  catching APA catching yawn time and time  again the perfect timing there on that  seismic shove as well but we're going to  be heading for a break ahead of shop  fire Bellion versus fly Quest let's see  how fly Quest is doing on are you  smarter  than you guys for us was done drinking  that's cool honestly I felt my throat a  little grappy at the  end get out get yeah wait how did I die  good good good good good that very kind  of  ter you of are you smarter than LCS Pro  next category we're going to talk about  some items we're doing the same thing  again so I'm going to say essentially a  build path and you're going to list as  many items that you can think of that  build from this specific item wow  they're worth one point each oh my God  so Bounty of Worlds builds into five  different yeah yeah yeah the five items  yeah uh dream dream oh he doesn't even  know the first one is blood song yes  that's one dream sleepy dreams good  dreams I know a dream catcher Dream  Maker let's go Dream Maker Dream Maker  there we go he not give it to him oh  it's there's three others then we got  Zach Zack what's the next part of it  come on no no no can I help him or not  you can't help him until he fails and it  bounces back to you so really don't give  me half point for Zach Zack please no  okay we're going to toss it to dig uh  Celestial opposition yes Solstice slay Z  realm Spike oh my God I'm B items all of  them I don't even read the new items I  don't know what the names are I was  hoping for some math questions not leak  questions  all I am going to read you the  description of an item and you're going  to tell me what item it is okay okay  unique hex charg gained 30 ultimate  haste unique overdrive I mean I know we  I me this the one that you buy a nocturn  first it what does it like how is it the  name hex  plat something hex your team your  teammates are dying he gets half a point  at least hexl hex hex PL can I say do  you know what it is experimental hex  plit yes good  job we get half a pointed it's rigged  cuz we set up Tomo we told him it's X  all right unique light Shield strike  your next basic  attack uh cycler no under Sky  yes colossal consumption while within  700 units of an enemy Champion generate  a stack on them each second stacking up  to three  times 30 per Target second cool down out  still yes then know it's hard still I  didn't even know it did off that  stuff that wraps up round two now we're  going to go to a  [Music]  break you  ready no I think so yeah you know just  remember stay in your lane keep your  vision up at all times you know time is  going to be everything here so you don't  want to go too fast but you also don't  want to  be I got  this yeah I think you do  and Mark  thanks whoa hey no no no whoa no you're  not taking my car my Kia ev9 no  [Music]  way no  [Music]  touching  Red Bull gives you  [Music]  [Music]  wings welcome back to the LCS I'm here  with sniper after the win against Team  Liquid and I have to ask you know your  first game in the LCS was against impact  on Team Liquid you did win but it felt a  little shaky here you got a solo kill  against impact how did that feel I mean  it felt amazing cuz I was like really  comfortable on this matchup and I knew I  would do good so when I got that solo  kill I was like I don't know I just so I  I had like so much energy after that you  know but then the energy translated into  just me dying to a gank much  another yeah and also you win yet  another game on 100 thieves you have a  lot of early season success is this how  does the early season compare to your  expectations going in from a team  perspective I think I already talked  about this but before the split I didn't  even think that I was like LCS ready but  when scrim started I started like  practicing more with my team I got  comfortable with the environment and I  started improving like drastically you  know and from then on it's been it's  been amazing that's awesome and it's a  really short regular season you know  after after Tomorrow there's only going  to be two more weeks of regular season  before playoffs what do you what are you  working on now because you're still such  a fresh player to the LCS just to think  ahead and basically just like just  constantly think about the game  sometimes I just autopilot like when I  died to that jungle gang so just being  aware of just everything going around me  at all times you asked me before what I  thought of that game I said it was a  banger game what what did you think  about that game what was other than the  solo kill what were some of the  highlights I was for sure a little  disappointed cuz after I got to solo  kill I was up like 20 Cs and if I just  didn't die to that sigu gank the game  would like have went on so much more  smooth you know so I think other than  that the game was pretty good A lot of  Team fighting yeah last question I  noticed during week one you have the  shirt tuck you still have the shirt tuck  why is that a thing bro this like Jersey  is so big on me by the way look at  this I look like I'm like back to school  you know so like I don't really want to  give up that Vibe I want to be like yeah  I love it it's working for you thank you  very much congratulations on the win  appreciate itk you we're done for thank  you guys thank you  [Music]  [Music]  h  [Music]  Aaron would be pretty good too I would  take I agree with you welcome back  everyone we got Shopify Rebellion going  up against fly Quest here we're going to  be taking on the draft so first thoughts  anyone first first last that's a good  one first place last place now there was  a question I had for our stats guy I  feel like a lot of times you  underestimate the team that's blow you  in the standing so he pulled post week  three all LCS history first place versus  last place including ties which is this  because Shopify was tied for last 60 and  21 oh so that's you know you do the math  about a 70 little bit below a 75% win  rate that still seems pretty high that  still seems pretty high last pry High  yeah that's shocking to me here's what I  won now hit  me boo made a bet it said if he got what  over 10K Twitter followers the pike bet  he was going to walk in  Pike actually and then they released a  thing with nuke duck  yeah here we go why is he going to pick  it again hope you guys are excited to  see  fik  which is really funny after talking to N  duck in the coaches interview last week  where he was like yeah sometimes you  just ask your players if they can play  something and then you figure out if  they can actually play it say yes  essentially um I think luo in general in  terms of him widening his champ pool  we've kind of talked previously about  how he used to be a midlaner um but he  has been a big difference maker in this  fly Quest botling and it's been really  really fun to see him kind of unleash  thus far this place it's interesting  you're talking about fly Quest I mean at  least the champion pool a little bit I  think we can actually talk about the mid  lane Champion pools for both of these  because to me that's the most  interesting thing between Jensen um  going up against Insanity because it's a  pretty wide difference of for what they  actually play there's the Oriana  switching it up so we got the Oriana  wait a minute we got the Oriana for  Insanity Turtle explain what's happening  well we just decided to be a little bit  more traditional now you know we don't  want to be that crazy with the Garen  Zach cion thought we if we played normal  stuff we might actually have a chance to  win this is actually this is actually  great having you here though because you  were on stage for the first two games of  the split with shop fire Rebellion  what's the what's the vibe like from  Shopify in champ select like who is  driving um it's kind of like a group  effort at the moment and Sam kind of  lets us like he puts like fuel to our  fire sometimes like if we suggest  something crazy he'll just let us do it  Sam is Revan yeah sorry Revan our coach  Revan I saw fly Quest hovering that k a  little bit kind of got me worried cuz I  want the kaisa on my  team oh  well let's see if we get it back let's  let's see if we get a back oh my God  yeah actually earlier I want the kaisa  earlier we showed a clip in which MSU  was walking through smolder so like  seems like that's a pick that they've  really clung on to and I mean they've  seen the earlier games Tomo ran a little  bit of a shot top in some of these team  fights he was he was a terror so being  able to see another smolder game is  going to be fun oh Z is pretty solid too  gu the vi Zyra con it up last  second like this is standard are con's  pretty good so far that's what I was  going to say I was like this is the most  standard comp I think I've seen you guys  run I started trying to win  now one of the training weights so so  maybe uh I can't decide whether it's  like that or you're trolling me and  somehow the Ori is going like top or  something no they got Ori time Ariana's  going mid okay so Turtle what's the  match up like with smolder versus z um I  just think it's like a farming L and  then you have the Recon being able to  threaten the smolder so I think it  should be pretty favored to zyon now now  that uh Kraken slay is like extremely  buff speaking of just threatening a pick  we got the azir locked in which is the  idea I'm sure alongside VI is to just  threaten Oriana mid so it's not going to  be that safe also just like azir versus  the short range of z um that being said  I'm reminded of a tweet that Jensen put  out where he said that Ori and air until  it's banned or zir was not banned Orana  was picked so there it is there you go  we're got a classic match up in mid uh  and you see they're not cowards they did  it yeah fly Quest taking out the nocturn  we've seen a variety of Oriana nocturn  combos some successfully some not as  successful uh and taking out Whos Olaf  from the shop fire bellying side Turtle  when you guys are looking at a team like  fly Quest cuz obviously people have to  prepare for stuff that insanity is going  to throw in the mid lane but when you're  looking at fly Quest do you consider  like wipo's Top Lane chample cuz he's  willing to slam a lot of unique picks  there yeah we're always a little worried  about giving him the counter pick but um  I think in this case we're always hoping  to get the uter we did we did not get  that so I wonder what fake gu is going  to do I'm guessing he's going to go for  the at  Tru he is an insane at TR dos player  yeah I think fly Quest will probably  pick the rata on the  four I I actually don't know what pair  is very well smolder yeah well you were  trying to figure that out earlier it's  still because it's such a new Champion I  think I think it will be rata on four  because uh just because I think it's a  good Champion the support match up verus  R more so than the ad carry pairing  would make a lot of sense and I think  boo is also a u a Rado player I mean or  pike pike is not very good but I hope he  picks it I was going to say I don't I  hope I hope he picks it I mean if you're  going to pick a hook champ this is kind  of Pike I mean it's locked he locked it  I'm a little shocked I didn't expect  that so what's your thought on this bot  Lane match up cuz he should have just  pick Pike at this point right I don't  know why he's going for the blitz just  like ruining it for all the fans out  there Wukong ALS brother zil look at  that beard oh my god wow they they can't  hear us can they they can't  respect although I could tell you that  they don't and then I wonder what you  say okay yeah I just said no and then I  was I was there it is the Wukong Boogie  Wukong this is the first time we've seen  it actually I got a couple Buffs I don't  know if it's good I'm still not a fan of  the champion but let's just see I think  those Buffs were more targeted at his  leaning right it was meant to  buff but he's always been such a good  jungler so I expect the atro to be  picked pick a lot of you cowards I feel  like there's a trend with people holding  up uh posters calling people cowards to  pick a champion it's working pretty  Weller honestly true there's the atro  that you expected and honestly shopify's  composition as a whole pretty solid it's  pretty solid very  standard it's  cohesive it looks makesense we got  Oriana pulls it all together there's a  lot of threats from the side of fly  Quest at least with with blitz crank VI  me a lot of single targets so Zia has to  be concerned that's going to be a Cante  being locked in so thoughts so far on  the compositions which ones you guys  favor I like blue side yeah why I I just  have unknown reasons why I  might okay well I I got we got that out  of the way uh we're handing this to the  casters but I've heard that ail has a  score to settle with  boo yep absolutely I mean here's the  thing you know buo tweeted out he said  he was going to play Pike I retweeted it  you know we helped him get the followers  he gain 1 th000 followers but you know  what when you break trusts there has to  be a reckoning here oh no it's coming  boo I told you if you lied if you B  Boozled I'm  unfollowing Allan I fear you have made a  terrible mistake losing the aale follow  that is like losing social credit at the  highest possible he can earn it back  though with a good Blitz game okay okay  cuz Blitz is pretty pretty hype yeah if  he picked like a Lulu that's like a  block you know that's the next step  Blitz earned him only an unfollow cuz he  lied to me but he lied to me with  something cool so yeah we'll give we'll  give him a pass I don't know lying is  still pretty bad is it it's true that's  why he got un followed all right like I  said if it was L he would have got  blocked all right you hear that Allan  you got to earn that trust back from Mr  aale the little world champion himself  yeah I'm I'm I'm excited for this game  really happy to get to cast the smolder  game I've been playing a lot of smolder  I actually think that the the build that  we saw earlier I think is a much  inferior build to what is actually you  know what I think is going to become the  meta is a much more tanky smolder build  I think shojun rush into riff maker  LeAndre is so ridiculously strong this  Champion's range is too short to  consistently stand in Auto attack so you  don't actually get a ton of value out of  really high attack speed that build with  the shojun rush gives you so much CDR  early both of the components and with  the item completion that allows you to  get Stacks really really fast and then  you're building three straight HP items  which allows you to really be pretty  tanky in these fights you turn online a  lot earlier compared to the crit build  as well yeah uh which allows you to have  a lot more kind of activity in these  early fights cuz smolder actually scales  by fighting it is not like you know an  azir or or a kale or whatever where  you're like okay I just got to get XP  and get minions and no the way you get  Stacks faster is by hitting people with  your abilities and the way you can  actually set yourself up for that is by  having you know a really strong early  build and that build lets you get there  uh it also allows you to Tech into a lot  of different angles you know for your  fourth item if you're just having a good  game you're not really threatening you  can go rapid fire you can go BT you can  go damage whatever but you know if it's  heavy physical and you're under threat  you're getting Dove you can go iceborn  if it's heavy magic and you're and  you're getting poked out you can go  kanic like this Champion can become a  brick wall where you're having 4,000 HP  but as long as you get your Stacks  you're still killing everyone it is so  powerful and I'm 100% convinced it is by  far the superior build so I'm really  going to be interested to see if masu  does go for that style or if it is more  what I think was the kind of like  initial jump that everyone did which was  basically just building him like Ezreal  yeah I'm I hope chat was taking all  those notes down because I'm pretty sure  I saw your head expanding literally as  you were just like dropping truth Bombs  all over about this uh other build for  smolder we're going to see though if  masu actually Ops into that or if he  goes for the crit Focus build that we  saw uh Tomo play I know the very first  competitive game smolder uh credit to  Lady Sports and messages from The  Challengers League also ran a crit build  as well I mean it still does damage late  game but I think that's an argument  worth having it's like having more  durability early protects you while  you're getting those Stacks up in first  place and it it's not like the [ __ ]  build is just straight bad like you will  do higher DPS if you're able to Auto  attack but the reality is in almost no  games I've watched wer and I've both  played and watched a lot of it can you  actually stand there and just Auto  attack it almost never happens the range  is very very short there is crit scaling  on the E so some people do kind of make  that argument but I just think it's so  irrelevant compared to uh the Synergy  that LeAndre and Rift has with the flat  damage amp you're going to get and how  tanky it makes you how early you can get  involved in these fights uh it is going  to be a comet smolder here he's playing  ghost flash so we're going to see W  level one pretty much guaranteed and I'm  curious to see how many points he's  going into it most of the pros I know  are are kind of of a mind that you go  three points W in the qax I have seen  when people are going more the build  that I'm talking about some people will  go Five Points W and it becomes really  powerful both for wave clear uh and for  a lot of these fights you the range on  it is very high if you're getting multim  man W's you know with that early Five  Points it is significant damage so uh  there's a lot to learn with this  champion doran's ring definitely the  correct start you know a lot of people  were kind of getting uh baited by going  dblade and is significantly worse you do  need the additional Mana the AP pretty  nice as well so it's going to be a fun  one to watch um also in the game we saw  earlier the smolder Stacks actually came  online very late you know generally uh  we'll see if if it is going to be slower  on average it in Pro because again it's  like even with perfect Farm you really  accelerate your Stacks by fighting right  so if there's less fighting in Pro maybe  the stacks will be slower on average  than uh in Solo que the fastest I've  personally been able to get it is around  17 18 minutes um most of my games I feel  like you know you're going to get it  maybe around like 22 or something but I  I'm not doing it perfect perfectly by  any means um I have heard of a game uh  where I think it was Nemesis apparently  got it in 14 15 minutes that's the  fastest I've heard of that is insanely  fast if you're able to like stack  perfectly there's also a lot little  tricks you can do again I don't know if  people are really going to let you do  them but you can stack off void mites  with your Q you can stack off off the  mini Raptors off the mini kugs like you  can start to onot all those pretty quick  and you can get a ton of extra Stacks if  your jungler is willing to donate those  over to you right so as we pull up our  Kia multi Lane I want to remind everyone  while we're on the live patch and you  know shout out to our Commish Mark Z for  letting us play on the live patch first  before any other major region Champions  when they are enabled are still the same  for every region which is 2 weeks that  is a global rule so there have already  been scrims and practice with smolder in  these past two weeks so we're going to  see how much fly Quest have really  rehearsed coming into their first game  of smolder exactly and also you know on  inverse side how well chop F can punish  um someone else I really want to talk  about is insanity because he has just  been doing such an interesting thing  this split you know bringing out you  know very unique picks he has played all  kinds of different Champions and a bunch  of them are actually ones that really  only he is playing you know if you're  not watching leagues around the world  you may not realize both Garen and Zach  he's the only one in the entire world in  this season not even just major regions  of any pro league including erls Etc  that has played these picks mid lane uh  there's also the Sion he is two out of  the total four picks globally as well in  any League again um to play it so he is  playing some very atypical stuff and  it's been a lot of fun to watch as buio  tries to time his hook with the minion  dematerializer but I think he did a  little bit yeah a little early I like  the the thought process problem with  piig Pike buddy would  you I think it was still the timing of  the I guess the the minion do  materializer but you know what I  sympathize with your plight here as  Boogie true you might have still had  that problem maybe maybe maybe now  Boogie was in the area but not a lot of  diving power with Wukong early on you  bring a lot of damage but no real CC so  just making sure that no one is in the  area and just providing some defensive  coverage in case it's fired ever off of  the reset that is about to go for comes  back bot Lane but Jensen's very low and  Boogie once again not a lot of diving  power on Wukong if you ever see that  then you have to know that it has to be  for a guaranteed kill and Jensen is  still safe in this position Insanity  doing very well though in this 1 V one  you know really has been pressuring  Jensen in these early levels Wukong they  touched on it at the desk did get Buffs  on this patch nice double w there does  connect and that's two stacks knock up  from buio as he KES on back to protect  masu making sure that they're not in the  Flash and B at the very last frame gets  out is going to be able to flash out of  there Jensen really getting lit oh my  goodness the pressure just kind of  non-stop there from sanity zazil going  to be able to stop Theo on that Recall  now you can see masu they want it to  reset and masu is still going to reset  but this means the wave is going to  crash unless Inspire can come hold it at  the very least he's going to lose some  these minions but we'll see can they get  BVO who has no flash yeah no flash  available he might pop the ghost but  they knock up into the Q as guarantees  the damage but B does enough damage with  zil First Blood and now inspir is forced  to flash don't tell me he gets out the  ghost kinding this one out Inspire is  waiting for the que flashes in front to  block it that's teamwork right there  that is a really smart Flash from zazil  if he does not go for that Inspire might  have been able to finish him off but  they try to go for the big play here  they try to look to punish bivy even  without masu there they can't do it he  walks out they give up first Blood  critical though for them it went to  zazil so you are really happy that at  least the first Blood went over to zil  but it's a 1.2k gold Le 1.3k briefly as  it jumped up there um only 5 and2  minutes in that is actually a ridiculous  lead this early on that is telling you  you're winning in farm you also have  that kill go so really really big you  can see dark seal here for masu for a  little bit more early laning power does  have the long sword so we'll have to see  where he's going to go long sword  obviously not telling us a lot uh it  does build into a ton of different items  could be shojun could still be Essence  Reaver um but I'm I'm very curious to  see where he's going to take us and  check on his build let's see what he's  doing so far he is just the two points W  as expected at the very least he's going  to go three and I kind of want to see if  he goes beyond that um after after he  hits level 7 yeah and guys this snot  bubble is going to deal a decent amount  of damage later into the laning phase as  you already see a little bit of that  power with theu as once again the replay  they try to look for the damage but it's  just just not enough once inspired comes  back and just really pristine Flash here  from BVO yeah nice flash does react to  it and then this is post inspired  flashing after him the Q is here just in  time but zil flashes in front support  dip blocks it up and Jensen going to be  forced to actually Shuffle him away as  in sany looks for the sombrero there  trying to connect on him with the alt he  couldn't quite find it that would have  been crazy you know Chef Chalet as degon  uh coined him was looking for a creative  angle there but now that is Jensen's  flash gone so the time Bui pays a visit  and he's going to be level six soon  that's an easy cyclan followup to make  yeah yeah you can hit him with that  Cyclone you know try to get in there  look for that gang setup obviously you  know being able to go into the Clone you  w in with the Oriana ball on you and  then you Nimbus strike for the shock  wave come through it is a really nice  little point of initiation especially if  you're coming out of a brush they don't  see you approaching that can be very  surprising and is that powerful engage  they can be looking for as nice little  flap flap there from masu gets out to  the side that that that fly is is a big  injection of speed but it lasts very  little times you kind of have to be on  point with it but you know as we see it  showcase there masu has the reaction  time be able to step out of it oh boio  might be in trouble here no flash and  there's the Cyclone from Boogie as he  gets ready to throw down the staff and  zil picks up another kill yeah nicely  done they get another kill again  unfortunately goes to zazil there's a  little greedy down on that bot Lane  share the love zazil two kills on the  Recon is the only two kills so far in  this game The W to prep the wave he's  going to look to try to last hit all of  these with the Q once you have 25 Stacks  again it becomes AOE becomes very easy  to just do W into Q on the backline and  one shot that and remember any minion  that does get last hit it's not just the  one that you shoot your Q at uh so if  you have AOE and you get a multiple  minions you get multiple Stacks with the  Q so it's something to remember uh you  really do have to focus on stacking if  you guys want to play this champion at  home and trust me uh even if you know  Pros are playing the crit build it's  definitely a lot easier to play the HP  based build because it's a lot more  forgiving for your positioning yeah yeah  building durability gives you a little  bit more breathing room and larger room  for error as fly Quest trying to prep  this Dragon but Boogie insanity and  zazil are also here 2K on the HP Lucio  with the hook finds zazil the auu gets a  decent amount of damage but zazil is not  in any threat just dances over the wall  and Red Team AKA fly Quest are able to  pick up the dragon yep going to be able  to grab that nice little bit of poke  back as well 49 Stacks now for masu so  not a crazy pace of course it does  accelerate as you get further into the  game uh it is going to be that Sheen by  so it likely will be the essence reever  again unfortunately I really want to see  the other build uh I I'll try to be a  build salesman you know got to go talk  talk to some pros convince him yeah I  was trying to sell tactical on it  earlier but he wasn't he he seemed  intrigued I won't say he was sold well  he definitely witnessed the power  smolder firstand in the the second game  of the day Mom they're pushing my tower  clear the wave please as fly Quest going  to be able to make sure that no more PL  go to the side of shif masu might be in  trouble decent knock up but it's more  damage done to zil than it is done to  masu here yeah not too big of a deal  chuse the ulti to clear that out uh he  is in fact going to three points W into  qax that's basically what we always are  seeing with the essence Reaver build  these days so is going to be going that  kind of more common crit build inspired  obviously just clearing away here on the  top side has been focusing on the camps  is a little bit ahead of the farm as a  result but Insanity here may be getting  caught  out looks like he's fine for now still  has flash Jensen doesn't so he has to be  a little bit more careful about how he  approaches the river here and Sanity  trying to set up an offensive position  in case he does first grub has already  been taken by Boogie and inspired has  flash available BVO is here as well  though and and smoulder is way behind on  the rotation so this should be Shopify  don't think they're going to be able to  contest on the FL Quest side and there's  no dragon to take as they already took  it just a couple minutes ago so full  grubs controlled by shop fire Rebellion  but is going to take this opportunity to  set up some aggressive Vision in this  red side jungle and zil knows he know  that they saw them dip into the fog of  War so now Z on B have to be careful  play through the mid wave the shock wave  is going to connect on the Jensen I  don't think he has flash quite yet he  has to shift on over and he gets out  alive yep going to be okay of course  there's not a lot of AP behind that  shock wave it's a tier and an amone plus  the doran's ring so Lucio oh nice  attempt there tried to time it out  obviously they have that Ward um you up  above as masu just looking for some W  poke here trying to get that WQ again  getting as many stacks as possible every  opportunity that he has and you can see  you know it's it's not as weak of a  laner as as people think you know in the  initial days people were all doing qmax  and they're well this Champion you can't  even Lane it's terrible you know how are  you supposed to get to those Stacks but  they're actually doing quite well in  this 2v2 you he is 15 CS ahead in fact  stacking reasonably well again we'll  have to kind of get a better barometer  for like what a good rate of stacking is  in Pro because it is just a lot less  Scrappy than when you're playing solo  queue and you're just having all these  fights non-stop where you can get a ton  of stacks yeah cuz if you have a long  extended fight where you're just queuing  someone on cool down and hitting  multiple people with your W you can walk  out of a fight with like 20 Stacks no  problem true I still can't get over the  fact that nmas is cut in this is  something that I I I haven't actually  watched the game this is what someone  told me so maybe this is totally fake  May um but I'm going to try to find the  VOD cuz I mean 225 I want see what the  fastest possible is yeah cuz we're about  12 minutes and masu has gone about just  under  so he still has about three more  iterations of this so if we're going at  this same Pace it would take until about  what 33 36 minutes to get there but  obviously maybe if there's more  scrapping towards the mid game he can  accelerate that and it does speed up as  you get more items cuz your your cool  Downs get lower so it's like early early  on in the game you're not getting every  single last hit with your que it's just  not going to happen because you need to  be able to actually push the wave and  and so on um as you get later on in the  game you do literally get like every  last hit with your que so it does  accelerate um but I I do think you know  even even if you're not getting it by  like 22 minutes at least for the games  that I've played that is pretty slow and  I think 22 minutes is nowhere close to  optimize um I do know that some other  players that I've talked to are saying  in their solo qu games they're able to  get it you know sub 20 basically like  very consistently so it'll be  interesting to see you know how that  does kind of work itself out in  Pro FL wins this game older his first  week will have more wins than L you're  not wrong yeah that's that's crazy you  know that just adds more to you know  late game scaling narrative for na  Marksman in general but fly Quest seem  to be preparing for this next dragon as  Shopify Rebellion are the first ones in  the river zazil marking making sure that  he's scoping out Vision here and  clearing out these wards that fly Quest  are trying to put down to give them that  safe entrance into this objective Point  looks like BVO is able to clear out the  wave first he's going to get the chance  to reset before Dragon spawns in the  next 40 seconds so he might be I don't  know if he has enough gold for a First  full item he does Kraken Slayer online  so BVO is going to be decently strong  for this next fight yep he's going to be  looking pretty strong up in the Top Lane  you can see bipo just went straight  towards that Thor mail Rush here you  know didn't stop for tabies I don't  really love the full Thor mail  completion you know as a first item I  just think in general heal cut early on  especially against atro if you're not  going to kill threat anyway is super  overrated uh I'm really just kind of a  fan in general of these builds where you  just go bomy and then you go into frozen  heart oranic depending on if you're  laning against physical damage or Mr and  then you just build the other like just  think that build is so strong uh be  interested to talk to bipo cuz he is  someone you know who really is very  opinionate about the builds and does  think kind of deeply about them you know  maybe the logic here is that he can just  kind of force trades and take a lot more  scraps that are going to be in his favor  oh shock wave right on the Jensen the  cyclone and the knockups from zazil  there is no room to breathe on that one  Shopify making a clean execution on  Jensen yeah Buu able to flash out but  Jensen not reacting in time or  potentially not thinking he needed to  flash um but he is going to be burst  down in a hurry so this Dragon should be  shif vised no problem off the pick there  Jensen going to be able to TP when he's  up but the dragon should be gone before  then yeah I think the only thing that Bo  is playing for is maybe an isolated pick  here in Spire weight teleport is being  committed by both top laners oh this is  going to be tricky boio is getting  chunked out looks for the silence but he  gets bursted out by BVO whip on the  other side on the wrong side of the  fight as well inspired getting marked  out by fot here's the teleport from  Jensen but Boogie secures it and he gets  out over the wall fly Quest they don't  really have an angle to force another  the fight unless BPO can find a knock up  with this Q looking for the third Q  right on to B boy but there is the  feather storm as he's able to get out  yeah going to be able to get out Jens  though looking for the angle the scoop  finds fake off but the angle is not good  enough for him to really find a kill on  there fly just really devastatingly not  getting anything out of this fight yeah  they don't get much whatsoever they try  to kind of force their way in anyway you  know clearly did not want to give up  that Dragon wanted to maintain their  dragon stacking here got the first one  trying to look for scraps again you know  when you have smolder you want to be  taking these fights getting those  additional Stacks from it but because  Jensen was picked off prior they did not  have a good setup whatsoever and  unfortunately for them not going to walk  away with anything you they didn't push  out the side Lanes they didn't really  get anything from  that I have to wonder if fly Quest are  oh no Jensen he has flash available he  should be fine flash away from the Q but  Boogie oh no Jensen getting taken out  Shopify Rebellion have really put a  focus on Jensen in this game and he is  he's had an incredible split so far this  is a game where he's really been the  focus though yeah he absolutely has and  you know we can take a look at how  Jensen is doing this split versus last  cuz he's actually been really good for F  this split on the left that is Jensen  this split on fly Quest on the right  that is Jensen last split on dignitas so  it really has been stepping up his game  and as a result clearly shop fight  coming in wanting to put the focus on  him wanting to try to knock him down a  Peg and they they have gotten Insanity  into this good spot he is definitely in  that advantageous position Boogie is  getting a lot of kills as well and  Wukong though is not as strong I think  you know when we were seeing it a lot  last year uh it's definitely a pretty  strong pick and it is someone that does  really well with gold you can snowball  heavily you can threaten that backline  especially when you have other people  that can dive with you like the raon  like the hrock like the assistance of a  speed up and a shock wave coming through  from the Oriana so you know boogie in a  great spot here to potentially carry  this game there are quite a few squishy  people on that other side you you're  looking at smolder you're looking at air  if smolder Miss positions at all with  this build you just get one  shot and Mogi is going to be still  dealing a ton of damage even though the  Divine Sunder made him so durable and  tanky with all the pseudo sustain you  were getting with those empowered Q  Stacks The Stride breaker recently  getting buffed on this patch is going to  ensure that once Boogie finds someone  he's going to stay on top of them with  that uh slow active that you get as well  the fact that five Rebellion are really  accelerated in this game against a  composition that is taking time to  really scale on up means that they have  the advantage to try and close this one  out before fly Quest gets to that point  yeah both the passive cleave got buffed  as well as the active on that little  shock wave there as masu just going to  be clearing out that wave uhoh but Mom  is not enough to bail out masu under the  tower and SP is going to be falling next  they got picking up an easy double and  they've got another charge here comes  the heral as it crashes once again  Shopify Rebellion 7 and Z at 18 minutes  against the number one team in the LCS  man they are looking so good in this  game they are crushing them and they've  already picked up wins against Cloud9  and energy they're picking up wins  against all these expected top teams  then they'll go and they'll drop games  against some the teams that you're  thinking oh they should be able to beat  these guys so it is so interesting uh  they have kind of become the new era CLG  the the counter logic gaming here um but  what a great queue there from fake got  interrupting the dash there from masu  when you get queued out of the flap flap  flap that is gone the followup was there  from zazil as he flashed forward and  they burst down  masu really making his job difficult you  he wanted to clear it out with the w  with the Alti got everything except the  cannon but the r is there too so they  just forc the Dive Right In on after it  and it looks like it's probably going to  be uh just a rapid fire second here for  himo just tangoing with fake on but  Boogie might be ready to Boogie himself  as pipo still has some reinforcements in  stage right as boo is going to escort  him out of danger there but Shopify  Rebellion I just want to Circle back to  the fact that they are doing so well cuz  all their wins have been against the top  teams in the LCS but I think that just  reiterates how you maybe you can say  whether it doesn't indicate the strength  and competitiveness of our region  overall but it's been super entertaining  that the fact that there's no free wins  that you can get with any single team  last year I think I bed two teams you  always be like ah well all right the  10th Place team is going to be taken out  here but every single team you cannot  just be at all complaining with them cuz  they will definitely steamroll ahead of  you absolutely I mean we saw the teams  coming in this week that were tied at  the bottom you know dig shopy dig  already got a win shopi looking like  they're in a great position to get a win  here as well uh these teams are very  competitive they have strong players  inspired is he going to go for it I  think he's too far gone yeah fake God  already burning the flash but inspir is  going to chase him past the tower and he  has boio here is it enough damage though  as he pops the world Ender and that  might just be enough to dissuade the  fight from happening and meanwhile  Boogie is on the other side of the map  taking a free dragon because fly quests  are dedicating so many resources just to  take out fake God yeah they're sitting  free top here they're going to be able  get a little chip damage now they're  going to TP it's five top for fly Quest  they need to make this work they they  are all in on this play a Teleport is  coming in from Shopify will it come in  time though Here Comes Mom thank God a  lot of damage but B Boy comes from the  right as he looks to be able to equalize  the fight Fon has already fallen but  quio might be the next one as boy cannot  Step Up in range and sity he gets  speared by Jensen on the back half  that's a double to fly Quest and a  little bit of light yeah that is big  getting a couple kills they needed to  make this play work here chai try to  come in and save him B boy in some  trouble potentially boo looking for the  hook but he Dodges out with his own  flash sa is ging bounce house in the  middle of all the boy finds one back on  a Jensen now to cut this one out against  pppo but he doesn't have the ultimate  anymore mosu is able to K the finishing  blow alongside pipo Here Comes Boogie  Cyclone finds the baby dragon has now  bipples left to scraps but he's got  three more members oh boio he falls does  boy Boogie does Havey enough damage here  here comes the the fight has lasted so  long Boogie just danced all over them  Boogie goes huge for Shopify fly Quest  felt like they were getting back into  this game but it's Boogie  crosses the map after taking the dragon  and crushes them on the play Fly Quest  they know they are behind they know they  need to make him play they already  forced out fake God all the mom comes  through the initial burst very good look  at that multi man W as well from wio  setting up the squad then the stasis  here from Insanity but as he steps  forward Jensen finds an angle to knock  him down we've got to look back at live  though as they are on the bear and this  play went on for a long time as the  Flash Forward from Jensen reacted to  there by B the mechanics on these  players are on point Boo in the area  gets Vision inspired is running from  base but will it be too late are they  going to try to flip this to Jensen  unless he can get a miracle steal but  the Smite is Good from Boogie Shopify  Rebellion 22 minutes in the game 12 and  four 6K gold up Baron at their side if  you told me this would be the result  coming into this game I would still be  surprised but man I have been loving the  LCS so far this season man this is just  such an exciting second game to follow  up what the Banger we already had in  Team Liquid in 100 thieves and it looks  like it just keeps on delivering in week  four yeah absolutely we've been getting  really cool picks the teams have been  very competitive has been a lot of fun  you for fly Quest at this point you want  to say well maybe smolder can bail us  out but not even 160 saacks here 22  minutes in so masu struggling to keep up  those Stacks you to still be involved in  the plays to maximize the stacking has  not really been able uh to do it yes you  do still the AER you have this molder so  if the game can go really long there is  opportunities but again with this build  there's so little room for error you are  so squishy with this build compared to  the more tanky versions and there is a  really powerful dive there's a five kill  Wukong who now has a sun sky plus that  stride breaker Insanity you know forming  pretty well you he's in a pretty strong  spot behind him on those two items so  it's going to be tough for masu to stay  alive even if he can get to the stacks  that he so desperately needs will he be  able to live in a fight I don't really  know and it's just not even two items  yet at this point compared to B boy  who's already working on a third so  severely behind and I think fly Quest  took a huge gamble by having such a  heavy scaling composition all eyes were  on inspired to really be that bridge but  ever since that bot lane outplay from  viy and zazil who I mean Bo has been  performing insanely well this game as  well but in every single win from  Shopify Rebellion so far it has always  been some type of fumbled attempt to  shut down BVO and zazil from the  beginning when you look at the energy  game they tried to go for the dive they  got blasted when C9 tried to go for the  dive they got blasted and when fly Quest  tried to upset them once again they feel  the same  fate it's tough man you you make  mistakes this team will punish you this  time you know wasn't about a dive or  anything like that I really think it's  just been about solid play here from  Shopify Boogie right place right time  everywhere he needed to be throughout  this game putting on pressure keeping  his farm up and he has really just been  such a Difference Maker here masu now  does have that rapid fire completed you  can see St through now for inspired as  well um but the item completion is still  not really inspiring a lot of confidence  that they can get it done here as  everyone on the other side is kind of  equal or ahead except for mid lane where  Jensen with that death cap now you start  to say hey maybe you get that right  fight for the azir and it could happen  yeah um but we'll see you know they do  have some xfactor style Champions they  have good engage they have good pick  with potential hooks from Blitz but  Blitz from behind is just such a bad  Champion it is really difficult to find  those angles for hooks as the YT just  getting throwing out time and time again  here for wave CLE they're just trying to  buy time they're trying to get these  Stacks it's 192 now for mosu so he is  closing in on that Benchmark that he  need there's pings there's PS for  teleport this is a long con fling from  wio but who do they want to look for  zazil is going to pop the quickness  finds the Target on inspired as well  they pull Insanity can they burst him  out he goes golden with the stasis does  it that enough time shock wave on to two  masu and Jensen are almost gone Jensen  survives but masu Falls as now the rest  of flight are all depending on Jensen to  save this game from ending right here  yeah Jensen in trouble he's got to run  they look for another one Jensen still  has no HP to work with almost going down  to than God he falls a straight feather  from B boy clips him as Shopify  Rebellion will find four and it's just  bio left oh that hook from boo might  have actually ended the game he hooked  him in and unfortunately it means yes  they get a kill but Jensen goes down as  well that extra little bit of damage was  all they need m is going to be back up  in five but he's got no sums he instant  ghost flash when he saw zil Ting towards  him then had no sums and no e to react  to the shock wave from Insanity that  caught him he instantaneously dies as  fake God comes over the top with the Q  looks like they won't feel confident to  try to push for the end here they're  going to continue playing towards these  objectives with the base in tatters the  inhib down in both bot and top this will  mean a lot of farming is going to be of  given over to them masu looking like  he's going towards Zia's third uh as the  itemization I'm guessing there you know  with the cloth Armor Plus the I mean  maybe just to sit on a Seeker so that he  doesn't get insta blasted but I I mean  at that point I don't I don't know it's  it's it's a it's tough right because  like I I'm saying this is the weakness  of the build which is why I think you  know it is it would have made a  difference in this game probably not so  let's just put that out there um but you  know I do think you know you are so  squishy it's so difficult to actually be  in range in Auto attacking that is why I  just straight up don't like [ __ ] build  um and we saw like he he's recognizing  you know what I can't really step up I'm  just going to get one shot and he  instantly had to use both his thumbs  then he just gets insta kill by the  shock wave plus that Q from fake God so  I think it is going to be Seekers or or  full zonas you know working towards that  just trying to stay alive hoping that  they overcommit maybe you can use stasis  to immune a shock wave and turn around  and fight in that way but yeah uh  obviously it's it's tough cuz when you  look at the compositions now on both  sides I mean like yeah fly Quest have  this insane scaling composition and you  have really one major form of disengage  that's the emperor divide once that's  gone there's nothing really strong from  the side of fly Quest that stops booy  from brw forcing into your team zazil  just blitzing right through fake God  just charging forward as well fly quests  are just so dependent and so limited on  how many ways to disengage in this fight  it feels near impossible yeah it it is  really tough right you know range is  kind of that weakness he finally has 225  Stacks so uh just you know before 28  minutes it did hit that Mark the  question is going to be can he actually  effectively use those Stacks now can you  get spam Q's out without just getting  one shot right cuz who are you supposed  to step up and Q in this if you step  forward to try to qu the atrox and he  eqs you you're probably dead if you get  caught by the Wukong you're probably  dead shock wave dead so it it is going  to be really really tough he kind of has  to really make sure that he's maximizing  his damage while still waiting out those  initial engage tools you know you have  to stay close enough that they can fail  the engage then you can punish that's  the only way they can win and they want  to get this TP from Jens and they're  trying to force it he's still staying B  he's refusing to come in just yet oh  Boogie tries to flank on inspired I  don't think he has flash available he  gets taken out very early on masu is the  next Target he has The Seekers this time  for the stasis but will even fall he had  the 225 Stacks but just not enough  damage as Jensen is trying to do work on  the front line while bipo stalling but  it's just not enough Shopify Rebellion  are taking everything away from fly  Quest they don't even need the baron  they have two in open Inhibitors are  going to just Pro forcer Wings in the  game B Bo flashing in Jensen tries to  punish but the rest of Shai Rebellion  rally around B voy their newest player  as Jensen just gets completely  obliterated by BVO shot by Rebellion are  going to do it taking down flag Quest  who are in sole possession of first  place they Crush through the Empire of  these top teams stand no match for the  rebellion of Shopify as they take down  again another first place  team fun game to watch here nicely done  on on the engage they start the baron  they look for the turn it is again  Boogie finds the ulti pops the Cyclone  flashes in on top of smolder and as mosu  tries to use the fly to get over the  wall to Flash Forward there from zazil  follows up on it ceing him out of that  ability locks him down bursts him down  no way for him to get out of there they  were really on point with the hard  engage here Chi you know people have  been kind of some people on one side are  really loving that they're cooking and  doing all these crazy drafts but there  has become a more vocal group there say  well you guys actually just can't play  normal you can't play a standard draft  you're not going to be able to actually  make it work they kind of just proving  the haters here a little bit coming out  with probably their most impressive most  solid win of the Season yes they had  already beaten some really top teams but  it was more from punishing their  opponent's mistakes on these failed  Dives this one was just them being  proactive them finding engages them  coming with a really strong draft that  worked from multiple angles combined  well you know shutting down what mosu  was bringing out here with the smolder  you know clearly they were prepared for  it they knew how to answer it and I just  think it's a really solid game plan  executed very very well from shocky yeah  I mean even just straight up mechanical  outplays as well you could tell that fly  quests were aware of  how how threatening B boy and zel could  be if they were ahead which is why they  threw the focus down there early on in  the game but just simple Mo Maneuvers  being able to dodge out on CC abilities  and then zazil flashing forward to block  inspired's cube when he was looking for  the cleanup and then even Boogie himself  I think he was also just a clear stand  out for me in this game saving what  could have been fly Quest comeback back  in yep the Jersey looking really nice  too dude yeah themed for Lunar New Year  today that's freaking awesome the red  and gold such a clean color clean on the  rift clean on the drip as  well as I believe we are ready we will  be joining wild turtle and fake God on  stage for the interview  [Music]  hello hi fake God hello how do you feel  after that win I feel great uh it's a  expected win as usual how' you guys how'  you guys get so good overnight uh I  think we were always this good we just  uh we were testing some uh stuff mid  lane a lot so it might have made our  team look a little weird but uh yeah we  just picked Oriana and just won just  that easy but how do you feel about your  coaching stuff you know like how how  does wild turtle stack up against wild  he's the best coach I've ever had he's  he's so good he always talks about  everything he's it's it's amazing it's  amazing that's why we won today guys  yeah how are you going to keep improving  moving forward uh we just we'll just  keep doing the same stuff just keep keep  on grinding I mean we're still like kind  of last place so you have to uh keep  winning so it's not over yet you know  don't

said congrats for listening to  instructions that you we take those all  right so you did better on this question  but dig  win  [Music]  absolutely thank you both for joining me  thanks for watching like comment and  subscribe  thanks for that Emily unfortunately fly  Quest lost again today and dig won so  that was a foretelling of what was going  to happen let's check out the players of  the game from today first comment cannot  be about the rolls what stands  out I I need to wow quids really  improved from last year fudge had a nice  bounceback for Cloud9 Boogie with the  great Wukong for me I am now a quidd  enjoyer okay quidd has had a great split  so far and it felt like after the last  split everyone's been holding their  tongue and then on top of that  everyone's kind of been attributing a  lot of success mostly to like working  alongside River but I think he's just  been standing out and I it's been great  to see a lot of progression that he's  had and the fact that 100 th had double  down on him and I want to call out  Boogie because we did talk about how  Wukong receed but Buffs on this P we  talked more that they were more targeted  towards Lan Wukong uh but he came out  with a really good game and also  something I noticed is that he was going  into his Lanes a lot more which is  really when I think he Excel a lot as a  jungler I'm going to steal I'm just  going to go for a second one Tomo  smoulder he for picking smolder  immediately he has been slamming that in  solo queue since smolder was released  and it worked out I was a little afraid  when he got cheesed by oay and he died  with both sums being blown but then he  ended up coming out strong in team  fights and overall like the tips and  tricks that he talked about in the  interview as well like he got to be able  to showcase the strength of smolder and  now we're starting to see it get picked  a little bit more so that's nice to see  stack him fast let's get into the  highlights for today  to see all those winners Cloud9 ended  their four game losing streak a rematch  of the summer finals from last split  they've actually beaten energy twice now  after this yeah I think in this game  more than the first time they met a lot  of it came off of some NRG kind of Happy  game moments let's just say like uh  there were and we'll we'll see how  energy uh regroup because after this  obviously they're now on a little bit of  a loss  streak but I think it feels really good  for C9 specifically especially since I  feel like maybe people won't have as  much to say about their draft this time  around it was a a lot more like ease of  execution uh was there and the team  looked pretty well coordinated they  outscaled for sure a Mortals versus  digas was looking pretty good for  immortals early for me castle with  another atro game way kind of dumping  damage but dignitas had a really cool  draft that was the thing uh at first I I  could just s him in I also felt like  okay they completely destroyed smolder  after like that second base it seemed  like it was going to be a pretty easy  game for me it was some of the fights  that IMT were St and Miss execute the  dragon fights for me for were a big one  actually this one was just a huge if I  remember correctly this is a this was a  way moment in a half man he blew them up  there were a few Dragon fights  there were a few Dragon fights but this  one was crazy and Sol for me solidified  IMT winning but that didn't happen yeah  I think the big thing for me is IMT  should not be fighting without Quay and  then dig were obviously just waiting for  smolder to come online and there was a  fight in the top side where it ended up  shifting in Dig's favor and that's kind  of when smolder started taking over yeah  third game of the day almost had a t  diff Team Liquid did pick up Soul during  this one but but 100 thieves so many  just massive Tia team fight wins that  led to quid's player of the game it was  actually pretty crazy this double flick  was insane so like that one I  immediately I thought Team Liquid was  going to win that fight before that play  ended up happening I think this was a  forc fight where the tar ulties were  just not hitting um so overall the team  fights team liqu found their lead they  were starting to solidify and I think  just too many fights that were just  getting  bodged yeah I mean this this is really  cool to see from 100 thieves though like  we've been talking a lot about their  success and a lot of it is due to the  way that they draft around the players  they have and the way they understand  the players they have probably the most  lopsided game of the day surprisingly  Shopify greater than fly Quest okay I  hated the blitz pick by the way I I'm so  mad that blz yes absolutely if you're  going to do nothing and lose you may as  well do it on Pike like I just don't  understand what the blitz C was supposed  to be doing maybe there's a future where  this ends up being meta and I can eat my  words but right now I'm going to say I  just hated it this was a really close  fight just specifically because this one  looked like um black West was turning it  mhm the Wukong who was doing Dragon then  went farmed mid then went topside to  actually help out in the play because he  realized it was going long enough and  then gets a triple kill so like Boogie  had an ideal gameplay after that one  what a split so far it's been a fun time  yeah it's been a really fun time I'm  actually I think I know the standings  like I think I could recite them yeah  but it's going to be close because the  worst  team three wins the worst team has three  wins like one game away from 500 to be  last which means Cloud9 is a game out of  last despite winning today you're going  to do this every day you're going to do  this yeah is in  last I was like here it comes but  they're a game out of 30 no seriously  it's uh it's just compressing so much  it's crazy I also want to shout out 100  thieves again they are are solidly in  second place like sole possession of  second place going into tomorrow uh  before we have a little break after that  and like even even if they lose tomorrow  right which they are facing kind of a  revamped rejuvenated C9 that makes this  match super interesting because I don't  think any of us or not I don't think I  know none of us expected this 100  Thieves Team to be looking as good as  they have and also be this high in the  standings dnit tosing uh NRG Team Liquid  Honda honestly shopify's hardest matchup  they're not going up against the first  place team so let's see how this one  goes yeah they're wingless against  second to eth oh my God they got to  change it sometimes it's tough it's  tough and Immortals versus fly Quest no  this was probably the easiest week on  paper for fly Quest they're like we're  six in one we're flying high we play you  know last place Shopify Immortals easy  20 let's go next nope that's not how it  works we have an interesting bunch of  teams I think it's going to be fun to  see how tomorrow goes but looks like  we're looking at the schedule watch this  right watch that right after this it's  on twitch.tv/ LCS Challengers Wild Card  versus fly Quest Challenger that  actually should be a banger and fearless  draft so you get to see lots of unique  Champions if you don't know what  Fearless draft is go over check it out  it's really cool that's it for us though  we'll be back tomorrow at 4 P p.m.  Eastern 1 p.m. Pacific so let's send it  over to apa stream he's streaming see  you over  there what play Elli and soul play  smaller High's driving he's got his  license oh my  God who he's going to be caught by the  bar but he's the only Target now
